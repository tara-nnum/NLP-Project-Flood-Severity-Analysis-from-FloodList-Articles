"UK – Over 1,000 Homes Damaged, Hundreds Evacuated as Storm Babet Triggers Major Floods","24 October, 2023","Parts of the United Kingdom continue to grapple with widespread flooding stemming from the passage of Storm Babet. Authorities have confirmed a grim toll of at least four fatalities linked to the storm that has swept the nation in recent days. Hundreds of people have evacuated their homes in parts of Scotland and central and northern England. Previously flooding from the storm caused major damages in southwest Ireland. The UK’s Met Office said Storm Babet brought a period of very heavy rainfall to many areas of the UK. Some locations recorded well over their average October rainfall in just a few days. Heavy rain from Storm Babet, falling on ground previously saturated from an earlier storm, caused flooding in parts of Scotland from 19 October 2023. The residents of hundreds of homes were told to evacuate in Brechin, Tannadice and Finavon in western Scotland, following warnings for flooding along the South Esk and North Esk Rivers. Police reported one person died after being swept into the Water of Lee in Glen Esk. A second person was confirmed to have been killed after a falling tree hit a van near Forfar. Rescue services were searching for a man reportedly trapped in a vehicle caught in flood water near Marykirk in Aberdeenshire. Homes were also evacuated in Peterculter, Aberdeen. Parts of Scotland previously saw flooding and landslides after heavy rain on 07 October 2023. Ten people were airlifted from their vehicles by a coastguard helicopter after flooding and landslides closed roads near Inveraray. As of late 08 October levels of the Tay in Perth were extremely high and the Dee and Spey Rivers both broke their banks. On 09 October one person was reported missing and later found dead in floods near the Tay River near Strathtay. In England, the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Suffolk declared major incidents in response to the extensive flooding from Storm Babet. In an update of 23 October, the Environment Agency (EA) said the total number of properties reported to have been flooded stands at 1,260. Environment Agency teams are out on the ground working in affected areas. Temporary defences, including pumps and barriers, have been deployed to minimise the impact of flooding where needed. Flood gates have also been closed in affected areas. An estimated 41,000 properties have been protected as part of the Environment Agency’s response. The EA’s flood warning service has sent out over 300,000 messages by email, telephone and text during Storm Babet. The EA said teams are still responding to severe flooding in the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire catchments, where some rivers have exceeded their previous highest levels from 2007. Derby City Council said the River Derwent saw record-breaking water levels over the weekend. Sarah Cook, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said, “More rain is expected, especially in the Nottinghamshire region falling on to saturated ground, meaning there is a risk of continued high levels on rivers such as the Trent and River Idle. Further significant river flooding is possible but not expected to continue into Wednesday.” Fire and Rescue service rescued or evacuated people from homes in Sandiacre, Long Eaton and Stapleford near Nottingham and in areas of Chesterfield where an elderly person tragically died trapped in a flooded house. The local Member of Parliament, Toby Perkins, said 400 homes in his Chesterfield constituency were flooded. Authorities urged residents of around 500 homes to evacuate after rising levels of the River Idle in Nottinghamshire threatened to flood areas of West Retford, Ordsal, Retford, Eaton and Gamston. The River Idle reached record levels of 1.79 metres in Ordsal on 22 October. The previous record high was 1.65 metres set in June 2007. In the county of Lincolnshire, Fire and Rescue Service said 170 homes and businesses have been flooded in recent days, mostly in areas of Lincoln, Horncastle, Tattershall, Woodhall Spa, Wainfleet and Kirkby on Bain. Around 40 people evacuated their homes in Wainfleet. The River Steeping reached a record high of 2.22 metres on 21 October. The previous high was 2.12 metres set in June 2007. Suffolk county declared a major incident due to flooding, asking people not to travel unless “absolutely essential”. Areas most badly hit by the floods were towns and villages in Babergh and Mid Suffolk districts. In the West Midlands of England, authorities in Worcestershire and Shropshire are preparing for flooding along the along the River Severn in the coming days. One person died after getting caught in flood water in Cleobury Mortimer in Shropshire on 20 October. Areas in the county of Yorkshire have also been affected. Around 250 homes were evacuated in Catcliffe near Rotherham where the River Rother reached record levels of 30.52 metres on 21 October. The previous high was 30.37 metres set in June 2007. “Our heartfelt sympathies and condolences are with those who have lost loved ones in Storm Babet as well as those who are experiencing the devastating impact of having their homes and businesses flooded,” Sarah Cook, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said. Previously Storm Babet caused major flooding and damages in parts of southwestern Ireland. Flood barriers were erected across Cork, Kerry and Waterford as Storm Babet started to sweep across the country on 18 October 2023. As of early 18 October, some roads were flooded in County Cork, including in Cobh, Glanmire, Killeagh and Midleton where 100 properties were flooded. Defence Force teams were deployed to Midleton to assist flood victims. County Cork Council also reported the flooding of properties in Whitegate, Rathcormac, Glandore, Ringaskiddy, Carrigaline, Raffeen, Halfway and Castletownbere. Roads were flooded in Castlemartyr after the Kiltha river burst its banks. The local government in County Waterford reported flooded roads in western parts of the county including Ticknock, Ballinameela and Aglish.

UK – Evacuations After Floods in Devon and Somerset,"10 May, 2023","Storms and heavy rain brought flash flooding to parts of England and Wales, United Kingdom, on 09 May 2023. Homes and roads were flooded in Somerset and Devon in the South West. Flooding was also reported in North Wales and parts of South East England. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said it received “widespread” calls for help due to flooding from around midday on 09 May 2023. Around 5 homes were flooded along with several roads in areas of Exeter, Devon. Roads and school buildings were affected in Tipton St John, near Exeter. The weather station at the Exeter Met Office recorded 41.5 mm of rain in 24 hours to early 10 May. A farm building was destroyed and a vehicle damaged after floods in Newton Poppleford, Devon. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service carried out at least 4 rescue operations for motorists trapped in floods in Taunton. In North Cadbury, Somerset, residents were forced to evacuate after 18 homes in the area were flooded. Seven flood warnings were in place as of 10 May 2023, including for the River Cam, which flows through the village of North Cadbury. Levels of the River Cam at nearby Weston Bampfylde reached 2.85 metres on 09 May. According to the Environment Agency, property flooding is possible above 0.60 metres. Flood warnings are still in place for areas between  Weston Bampfylde and Speckington. The River Otter at Dotton, near Newton Poppleford, reached 1.55 metres on 09 May. According to the Environment Agency, flooding of low-lying land is possible above 1.40 metres. Areas of Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Essex and Cambridgeshire in England saw heavy rain as the storms moved east. Some rail services from Cambridge were suspended due to severe weather. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service say they received a number of reports of flash floods in the Wrexham area, where several roads were flooded.

Intense Downpours in the UK Will Increase Due to Climate Change Says New study,"9 March, 2023","In the United Kingdom, intense downpours exceeding 20mm of rain per hour could be four times more frequent by the year 2080 compared with the 1980s, writes Elizabeth Kendon, University of Bristol, for The Conversation. In July 2021, Kew in London experienced a month’s rain in just three hours. Across the city, tube lines were suspended and stations closed as London experienced its wettest day in decades and flash floods broke out. Just under two weeks later, it happened again: intense downpours led to widespread disruption, including the flooding of two London hospitals. Colleagues and I have created a new set of 100-year climate projections to more accurately assess the likelihood of heavy rain downpours like these over the coming years and decades. The short answer is climate change means these extreme downpours will happen more often in the UK – and be even more intense. To generate these projections, we used the Met Office operational weather forecast model, but run on long climate timescales. This provided very detailed climate projections – for every 2.2km grid box over the UK, for every hour, for 100 years from 1981 to 2080. These are much more detailed than traditional climate projections and needed to be run as a series of 20-year simulations that were then stitched together. Even on the Met Office supercomputer, these still took about six months to run. We ran 12 such 100-year projections. We are not interested in the weather on a given day but rather how the occurrence of local weather extremes varies year by year. By starting the model runs in the past, it is also possible to verify the output against observations to assess the model’s performance. At this level of detail – the “k-scale” – it is possible to more accurately assess how the most extreme downpours will change. This is because k-scale simulations better represent the small-scale atmospheric processes, such as convection, that can lead to destructive flash flooding. Our results are now published in Nature Communications. We found that under a high emissions scenario downpours in the UK exceeding 20mm per hour could be four times as frequent by the year 2080 compared with the 1980s. This level of rainfall can potentially produce serious damage through flash flooding, with thresholds like 20mm/hr used by planners to estimate the risk of flooding when water overwhelms the usual drainage channels. Previous less detailed climate models project a much lower increase of around two and a half times over the same period. We note that these changes are assuming that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at current rates. This is therefore a plausible but upper estimate. If global carbon emissions follow a lower emissions scenario, extreme rain will still increase in the UK – though at a slower rate. However, the changes are not inevitable, and if we emit less carbon in the coming decades, extreme downpours will be less frequent. The increases are significantly greater in certain regions. For example, extreme rainfall in north-west Scotland could be almost ten times more common, while it’s closer to three times more frequent in the south of the UK. The greater future increases in the number of extreme rainfall events in the higher resolution model compared with more traditional lower resolution climate models shows the importance of having k-scale projections to enable society to adapt to climate change. As the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, at a rate of 7% more moisture for every degree of warming. On a simple level, this explains why in many regions of the world projections show an increase in precipitation as a consequence of human-induced climate change. This new study has shown that, in the UK, the intensity of downpours could increase by about 5% in the south and up to about 15% in the north for every degree of regional warming. However, it is far from a simple picture of more extreme events, decade by decade, as a steadily increasing trend. Instead, we expect periods of rapid change – with records being broken, some by a considerable margin – and periods when there is a pause, with no new records set. This is simply a reflection of the complex interplay between natural variability and the underlying climate change signal. An analogy for this is waves coming up a beach on an incoming tide. The tide is the long-term rising trend, but there are periods when there are larger waves, followed by lulls. Despite the underlying trend, the time between record-breaking events at the local scale can be surprisingly long – even several decades. Our research marks the first time that such a high-resolution data set has spanned over a century. As well as being a valuable asset for planners and policymakers to prepare for the future, it can also be used by climate attribution scientists to examine current extreme rainfall events to see how much more likely they will have been because of human greenhouse gas emissions. The research highlights the importance of meeting carbon emissions targets and also planning for increasingly prevalent extreme rainfall events, which to varying degrees of intensity, look highly likely in all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The tendency for extreme years to cluster poses challenges for communities trying to adapt to intense downpours and risks infrastructure being unprepared, since climate information based on several decades of past observations may not be representative of the following decades.

UK – Thousands of Trees to Be Planted at Flood Defence Project in Northern England,"22 February, 2023","Thousands of trees are to be planted as part of a flood defence project in northern England. England’s Environment Agency said 7 hectares of woodland and over 5km of hedgerow are to be created as part of a large ‘aquagreen’ project that will store floodwater and reduce flood risk. The project is part of the agency’s  vision for natural flood management to be seen as a core part of the nation’s defence against flooding, alongside its programme of “crucial bricks and mortar hard defences” New research by Forest Research estimated Great Britain’s trees contribute over £400m annually in benefits in the fight against floods. The project to plant thousands of tree and hedgerow seedlings has started at a flood defence project in Castlehill, East Hull, to create new woodland habitats for local wildlife. The project will reduce flood risk to over 800 properties and key infrastructure in east Hull. Tree species such as field maple, downy birch, English oak, and black alder are being planted along with different species of willow for hedges and field rose, dog rose, guelder rose and blackthorn and hawthorn to create scrubland. The planting programme started this week with a group of 20 volunteers planting hundreds of trees over three days. Andrew Barron, the flood risk advisor at the Environment Agency, said, “Woodland habitat holds high biological value and the new hedgerow planted across the site will promote a green corridor. We also plan on converting some of the arable land into open grassland which also has great biodiversity value and will be excellent habitat for many conservation priority species, such as skylarks, barn owls, and butterflies. “We had a great response from volunteers locally and will be doing more planting this month as part of our ambitions to create new woodland habitat as part of our flood defence work to better protect homes from the risk of flooding. “Species will be allowed to naturally recolonise areas to create a natural woodland with scrub and grassland fringes to support a diverse make up of species and is expected to reach maturity over 15 to 20 years.” EnglandGreen InfrastructureLow Impact DevelopmentSustainable Drainage Systems",https://floodlist.com/protection/trees-flood-defence-project-east-hull,0,,400,,"Great Britain’s, England, woodland, Castlehill, Woodland, East Hull",False,True,True,OtherFlood + Numerics
UK – England May Be Set to Flood at the End of Winter – Here’s Why,"12 January, 2023","England may be set to flood at the end of winter 2023. La Niña conditions, global weather patterns, climate change, lack of flood management measures, housing on floodplains and dated sewerage systems are al factors,  writes Jonathan Paul, Royal Holloway University of London for The Conversation. Within the space of a week in February 2022, England and Wales were affected by three severe storms (Dudley, Eunice and Franklin). Persistent heavy rain led to the flooding of around 400 properties and severe flood warnings were issued for several major rivers, including the River Severn. Now, the UK Met Office is predicting that England is again set to experience severe flooding in February 2023 – a prediction the forecasters attribute to a global weather phenomenon called La Niña. El Niño and La Niña are the two separate phases of the El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO). This is the name given to the phenomenon of irregular annual variations in sea surface temperatures (by as much as 3℃), air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific Ocean. A La Niña event is characterised by significantly lower sea surface temperatures in areas of the Pacific. Further research is needed into the effects of global weather systems on winter weather in the northern hemisphere. But wide variations in Pacific sea surface temperatures can set off a chain reaction of extreme weather across the world. La Niña can destabilise atmospheric pressures in the Atlantic Ocean and lead to heavy rainfall in western Europe and the southern US. But other factors may also contribute to the Met Office’s flood prediction. These include the long-term impacts of climate change and urban development in areas prone to flooding. During a La Niña event, cooler water decreases the temperature of the air immediately above the sea and causes it to sink. This creates large areas of low pressure in the Pacific Ocean which generally lead to increased rainfall in the surrounding region. However, these extensive low pressure areas force pools of high pressure northwards towards Europe. This manifests initially as drier and colder weather conditions in the UK as the seasonal rains brought by low pressure rain-bearing depressions from the Atlantic are blocked by persistent high pressure conditions. The first half of December 2022, for instance, marked the coldest start to a UK winter since 2010. The monthly temperature average was 1.3°C lower than the December average between 1991 and 2020. Powerful storms are instead likely later in the season. As the high pressure recedes and La Niña shifts jet stream patterns northwards, the usual pattern of westerly depressions is allowed to resume. Cooler-than-usual Pacific ocean temperatures in recent months have prompted scientists to predict that there is a 76% chance that La Niña will persist until the end of February 2023.  La Niña conditions may result in heavy late winter rainfall. But the UK is experiencing increasingly extreme weather conditions all year round. The long-term impacts of this could create conditions favourable for flooding. Southern England faces long periods of drought each summer. Last year, the Anglian, Thames and Wessex water supply regions all recorded their fifth-driest summer since 1836. This has increased the risk of flooding as ground surfaces become less permeable to rainfall infiltration. Despite recent low intensity rainfall, the risk of flooding in the areas affected by drought may still be high. Cold temperatures, like those experienced in December, may also return later this winter and further reduce the ground’s capacity to absorb water. Underground, chalk aquifers dominate central and southern parts of England. These aquifers, like sponges, have a finite capacity to accept and transmit fast flowing water. Heavy rainfall may therefore be forced over land where it can flow rapidly. Research indicates that above ground, water can flow at up to 100 times the speed of its flow through aquifer rock. This water flows into sewers and rivers and can overwhelm their natural or operational capacities. Rivers then break their banks and cause flooding. Several other factors also increase the likelihood that heavy rainfall this winter will cause parts of England to flood. Over half of England’s major urban flooding events in early 2022 were driven by underground blockages of dated sewerage systems. Their insufficient capacity caused them to fast become overwhelmed by debris floating in floodwater. Some UK cities, such as Hull, Bristol and parts of London have also been developed on river floodplains. Land on floodplains is often cheap, flat and, as such, easy to build on. But this makes these cities prone to flooding. Flood risk mapping has revealed that 19% of Gloucester, a city in the southwest of England, is at risk of regular flooding. Climate models are now predicting climatic changes and global weather patterns with increased accuracy. But mitigating against their environmental impacts often proves challenging. England requires extensive infrastructure changes to reduce the threat of flooding. One option is to prohibit the construction of housing on floodplains. However, urban planning approaches such as this involve overcoming legal and regulatory barriers. Another approach would be to improve sewerage capacity to account for population growth and its associated pressure on water use. Yet the completion of large infrastructural measures takes time. Various different stakeholders, including the public, must be consulted, while competing designs have to be assessed by experts and their impact modelled. It took 15 years, for example, for London’s Thames Barrier to be completed following its initial conception. Flood management measures also require the political will for implementation. This has not always been forthcoming, particularly when flood management is considered unduly expensive or environmentally damaging. For example, river dredging was long considered an unsuitable flood mitigation technique for the Somerset Levels in southwest England. But winter flooding in 2013-14 led to its immediate and ultimately successful implementation. In the absence of these changes, the UK should brace for a fresh wave of flooding at the end of winter. Driven by a La Niña event, but exacerbated by urban development in areas prone to flooding and the impacts of climate change, the effects could be severe.

"UK – One Missing After Flash Floods in Scotland, 140mm of Rain in 48 Hours","19 November, 2022","Police in UK report that one person is missing after being swept away by flash floods in Scotland on 18 November 2022. Heavy rain fell across Scotland from 16 November, in particular areas of the north east. The UK’s Met Office said close to a month’s worth of rain fell across parts of Aberdeenshire and Angus in 48 hours to 18 November. As much as 140 mm of rain was recorded in Charr in Aberdeenshire. The village of Aboyne in Aberdeenshire recorded 71.4 mm of rain in 24 hours on 18 November. Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said “We are seeing significant impacts from rivers in parts of Aberdeenshire and Angus. Seven severe flood warnings are live in Kintore, Kemnay, Inverurie, Ballater and Aberdeen (Dee), Brechin and Finavon and Tannadice.” One person was reported missing after being swept away by flash flooding in Aberdeenshire. Scotland’s North East Police Division said searches are continuing following a report of concern for a woman in the water at the River Don near Monymusk on the afternoon of Friday, 18 November. Inspector Rory Campbell said: “Officers, along with colleagues from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and the Coastguard, have resumed searches in the area where the woman was last seen. “Conditions are tricky and dangerous and I am appealing to members of the public to stay away from flooded areas. Please be careful when you are out and about.” Aberdeenshire Council opened rest centres in Ballater, Aboyne, Inverurie and Kemnay for those needing help and who are unable to stay in their homes. Local media reported residents of Ballater were preparing for severe flooding as levels of the Muick and Dee rivers were rising. Around 40 caravans were evacuated from Ballater Caravan Park. Rail services were severely impacted. Hundreds of travellers were left stranded in Newcastle, England, due to the cancelled services to Scotland. Several roads were flooded in Aberdeenshire as well as parts of Angus, Fife and Dundee districts. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said “Our Operations Control rooms are receiving a high number of emergency calls due to flooding in Brechin, Forfar and Dundee. We ask the public for their co-operation. Please only call if there is a serious emergency with risk to life.” Cars were seen partially submerged along a major road near Ladybank in Fife. Some residents evacuated their homes in Brechin. Localised flooding was reported in areas of Edinburgh, leaving vehicles stranded. Earlier in the week heavy rain caused flooding on roads in southern England, in particular in West Sussex. Local media reported 20 vehicles trapped on a flooded road in Chichester on 16 November 2022. West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said they responded to 70 flood-related incidents, including rescuing people from cars and flooding in buildings.

UK – Hundreds of Homes Damaged After Storm Franklin Causes Rivers to Rise,"23 February, 2022","Hundreds of homes have been flooded in England and Wales after heavy rainfall from Storm Franklin caused rivers to rise from 20 February 2022. Authorities say flood defences have protected more than 40,000 properties despite record river levels. The Environment Agency said the worst of the flooding in England was along the River Ouse in Yorkshire and the River Severn in the West Midlands, where a severe flood warning (highest) was issued for Ironbridge in Shropshire and Bewdley in Worcestershire. Some residents have evacuated their homes, while roads have been closed and rail services suspended. The Buildwas measuring station showed the Severn reached 6.55 metres late on 22 February but has since fallen slightly. The record high here is 7.04 metres recorded in November 2000. The River Severn at Bewdley stood at 5.33 metres as of 23 February and was expected to rise slightly later in the day. The record high is 5.56 metres, also recorded in November 2000. Damage to homes and some evacuations were reported after rivers caused flooding in other areas of the country from 20 February, including the Mersey in Greater Manchester, the Derwent in Derbyshire, the Wharfe in North and West Yorkshire and the Don in South Yorkshire. The River Mersey at Brinksway in Greater Manchester reached a record 4.4 metres on 20 February, beating the previous high of 3.97 metres set on 6 November 2000. Katharine Smith, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said, “So far we have received reports of around 400 properties having flooded over the past few days. Our thoughts go out to all those affected – flooding can and does have a devastating impact on people’s lives. “We have teams out on the ground taking preventative action, closing flood gates, deploying temporary barriers and moving pumps and other response equipment to areas of highest risk. Environment Agency defences have protected more than 40,000 properties despite record river levels.” In Wales, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) reported high levels of the River Severn in Powys. Residents of Llandinam near Newtown evacuated their homes after flooding late on 20 February. Franklin is the third named storm to hit the UK within a week, following Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice, which killed three people and left 1.4 million homes without power. Franklin also cause some coastal and flash flooding in parts of France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

UK – Flash Floods Cause Chaos in Eastern England,"11 July, 2021","Heavy rainfall in eastern England, UK on 09 July 2021 caused streets to flood, disrupting traffic and damaging homes and businesses. The city of Peterborough in Cambridgeshire was the worst affected. Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service said they responded to over 160 incidents of flooding in the space of a few hours during the evening of 09 July 2021. Around 20 elderly people were evacuated from a retirement home. Flooding also damaged a local sports stadium. Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service said, “Heavy rainfall has caused flash flooding in Peterborough this evening. Please do not attempt to drive through flooded roads. Bourges Boulevard area is among the areas badly affected. Roads are looking like rivers so please avoid the area until the water subsides. “Please also be aware that some manhole covers have lifted posing a risk to anyone walking through flooded roads. Please just avoid the flooded areas for now. Thank you. “Emergency services are working together with other partner agencies to help those affected.” Flooding was also reported in areas around the city of Norwich in Norfolk, damaging some buildings and leaving roads impassable. In an interview, Weatherquest forecaster Dan Holley told the BBC that parts of Norwich saw 50mm of rain, while Peterborough saw as much as 90mm. “That’s nearly two months’ rain in the space of two hours,” he said.

"UK – 300,000 Homes in England Now Better Protected From Floods Says Environment Agency","24 March, 2021","More than 300,000 homes in England are now better protected from the effects of climate change compared with 2015, the UK’s Environment Agency announced on 24 March 2021. Exceeding its target in delivering the government’s £2.6 billion investment in flood and coastal defence schemes since 2015, the Environment Agency and partners have completed more than 700 projects to better protect more than 300,000 homes, nearly 600,000 acres of agricultural land, thousands of businesses and major pieces of infrastructure. The milestone was reached with the completion of the Hull: Humber Frontages scheme, a £42 million project which will better protect the city of Hull from the devastation of tidal surges which caused flooding to hundreds of properties in 2013. The delivery of the nation’s new defences, which has continued through lockdown with Covid-secure working arrangements, will not only help to save the economy more than £28 billion in avoided damages over the lifetime of defence assets, but also provide reassurance and peace of mind for communities and encourage economic growth. The successful delivery of the programme comes ahead of the start of the record £5.2 billion investment in 2,000 new flood and coastal defences between 2021 and 2027. Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency, said, “The success of this programme is measured in numbers – 700 projects, 300,000 homes, nearly 600,000 acres of agricultural land, thousands of businesses and major pieces of infrastructure, on time and within budget. But the sense of security these protections bring to people, and the benefits to nature, can’t easily be demonstrated on a spreadsheet.” Recently completed flood protection schemes in England also include the £67 million Ipswich Barrier in Suffolk, which will protect 1,600 homes and 400 businesses from flooding and the impacts of climate change over the course of the next century. The Boston Barrier gate is now fully ready and working, giving an enhanced level of flood protection to over 13,000 homes and businesses in the town. As the centrepiece of the flood scheme, the barrier gate can be raised in just 20 minutes, responding quickly to threats of North Sea tidal surges. With the whole of the £100 million Environment Agency scheme now two-thirds complete, the project will provide Boston with one of the best standards of flood defence outside of London. Once the scheme is fully completed in 2022, flood risk to over 14,000 homes and 800 businesses will be greatly reduced and allow for the effects of climate change for the next 100 years. Flood defence schemes have also involved natural flood management, for example at Smithills near Bolton, where log dams and tree planting help to store water in upland areas in order to reduce flood risk for communities in Bolton downstream. The dams help to store the equivalent of four Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water upstream. Around 38,000 native broadleaf deciduous trees have also planted to intercept surface water, create habitat for the local wildlife populations, and help with carbon sequestration, with more to come. Work is already under way on the delivery of some of the 2,000 new flood and coastal defences that will better protect a further 336,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion by 2027, which will also see the implementation of the Environment Agency’s Flood and Coastal Risk Management Strategy.

"Storm Christoph: UK Flood Response Improving, but Lockdown Confused the Messaging","26 January, 2021","Overlapping disasters struck parts of England and Wales in January as Storm Christoph battered communities which were already suffering from the effects of a prolonged period under lockdown. It was the first time in recent memory that the UK authorities were required to address two such huge events at the same time. The storm wreaked havoc, threatening thousands of homes and leading to evacuations in some areas. The costs of yet another major storm will be felt by the affected communities for months to come. The response to Storm Christoph has revealed the UK’s strengths and weaknesses. On the plus side, the authorities are now well versed in handling major floods – learning from previous disasters in Somerset in 2014 and Storm Dennis in 2020. Extensive early warning, planning, procedures and flood mapping are now in place. Over 300 flood alerts were issued by the Environment Agency in the three days leading up to the storm hitting. This gave communities due warning of the potential of severe flooding. In some instances, prior evacuation by citizens and communities was recommended and indeed required. So in this sense, crisis communication was good. For the most part, UK emergency planning has become astute at dealing with single hazard emergencies. Incidents that are restricted to geographical areas where local emergency flooding plans can be enacted with more ease. Yet despite a commitment to an “all hazard approach” – planning to meet differing types of shocks and threats – the floods have revealed that the UK is not, in practice, very successful in dealing with overlapping disasters. Multi-hazard threats require agile decision making. In the case of Storm Christoph, initial indications suggest that there was a lack of joined-up crisis communication which linked flood advice – even evacuation guidance – with the requirements of also meeting COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. People were, in many instances, not clearly informed about how they were supposed to evacuate their homes and meet the requirements of staying within COVID-19 bubbles. There was confusion over what people should do if they were forced to leave their homes. Could they stay with friends? Or would that put them in danger of COVID-19? As Didsbury West councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the BBC: You have a situation where, for the last year, people have been repeatedly told to stay at home for their safety suddenly getting this conflicting advice. Nor was it entirely clear how emergency responders would be able to provide flood-related support without making them further vulnerable to COVID-19 contagion. Key advice was eventually forthcoming – at least in north-west England – where residents were informed that they were exempt from COVID-19 legislation in this scenario and they should not hesitate to evacuate. But the clarity of this advice was far from uniform across the country and was issued at differing times. Effective crisis communication relies on a clear and timely framing of the challenge – in this case the overlapping disasters. It is also important to outline what the local capabilities and requirements are. And clear information about how the local population can respond to the crisis is crucial. This applies across the world, from the UK to Africa. My own research, with colleagues at Bournemouth University, shows that poor framing (such as weak communication) can lead to a lack of compliance. This in turn leads to citizens blaming emergency managers for any failures. People must have trust and confidence that they are both heeding critical flooding advice and staying compliant with pandemic restrictions. This cannot be ignored: flooding is here to stay and lockdowns may be something we all have to learn to live with for the foreseeable future.

UK – Storm Christoph Floods Prompt Evacuations,"21 January, 2021","Storm Christoph brought heavy rain to parts of the UK from 19 January, 2021, increasing river levels in parts of North Wales and the North West of England. The UK’s Met Office said: “Storm Christoph brought some heavy, and at times record breaking, rain to parts of the UK. Provisional figures show Honister, in Cumbria, received 123.8 mm of rainfall on Tuesday (19th Jan), a new daily rainfall record for this winter and 2021. However, it was well short of England’s all time January daily rainfall record of 180.4mm set in 2005. Provisional figures also show the 19th was the wettest January day for Rochdale (46.8mm), Preston (43.6 mm) and Stonyhurst, Lancashire (43.8mm) since 1954. While parts of Cleveland, in North Yorkshire received more than their average January rainfall over just 2 days, the 19th and 20th.” Around 2,000 families evacuated their homes in parts of Manchester and Merseyside, England, and Wrexham in North Wales after heavy rain from Storm Christoph caused rivers to rise overnight, 20 to 21 January 2021. Media in UK reported further evacuations in Warrington (80 people) and a 48 people from a care home in Northwich. Five people were rescued from floods in Bewsey, Warrington. Roads were closed in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Shropshire, where 5 people were rescued from trapped vehicles and some train services suspended. Around 80 people were evacuated after eight streets were left under water in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, Wales. Flooding was said to be related to mine works in the area. The Mersey at Northenden, Manchester, reached 3.27 metres on 21 January, where minor flood stage is 1.8 metres. At Sankey Bridges in Warrington, the Mersey reached 4.54 metres, where minor flood stage is 3.8 metres. Meanwhile in North Wales, the Dee River at Bangor-on-Dee, Wrexham, reached its highest ever recorded level of 16.46 metres on 21 January. Weather conditions have improved, but days of rain☔️ recently means river levels are still high with floods in many areas of #England & #Wales. Less rain to come in the next few days.

UK – Widespread Flooding After Storm Bella,"28 December, 2020","Heavy rainfall brought by Storm Bella caused flooding across Central England over the last few days,  prompting evacuation orders and high water rescues. Strong winds from the storm also caused severe damages and left thousands of households in France and the UK without electricity. The Isle of Wight in southern England saw wind gusts of 170km/h. Heavy rain from the storm caused rivers to break their banks in parts of Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Worcestershire. Authorities advised residents of 1,300 homes in Bedfordshire to evacuate on 25 December following flooding from the River Great Ouse. Around 40 homes suffered flood damage in the town of Bedford. Around 1,000 people were evacuated from a flooded caravan park at Billing Aquadrome in Northamptonshire after the River Nene broke its banks. A further 20 homes were evacuated in Kettering, Northamptonshire Search and Rescue Services said. Severe flooding was also reported along the Severn in Worcestershire, in particular in areas around the small town of Upton-upon-Severn. Heavy rain caused flash flooding in Oxfordshire on 24 December. About 40 homes were flooded in Witney and Fewcott. In Norfolk, hundreds of families in Thetford, Brandon and Hockwold were advised to leave their homes on 26 December due to the threat of flooding from the rising River Little Ouse. In Cambridgeshire the River Great Ouse broke its banks causing flooding in several areas including the town of St Neots. In North Yorkshire, flash floods overnight, 26 to 27 December prompted high water rescues in Hawes, Aysgarth and Wensley, according to North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. Heavy rainfall was also reported in parts of Scotland. The UK’s Met Office said that Achnagart recorded 82.6mm of rain in 24 hours to 26 December.

Natural Resources Wales said on 19 December that the Ritec river at Tenby “remains at its highest recorded level due to a combination of yesterday’s heavy rainfall and high tides.”  The flood threat prompted the nearby Kiln Park Caravan Park to close and all residents to leave the site. In southwestern England, Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service evacuated 18 people from a flooded caravan site in Notter Bridge in Saltash, Cornwall after the River Lynher broke its banks. Environment Agency figures from the nearby river gauge at Pillaton show that levels of the river jumped from 0.85m on the evening of 17 December, to a record high of 2.44 metres in the early hours of 19 December, which is well above flood warning mark of 1.5m.

"Insurers Float Fast Flood Protection, as Britain Fails to Confront Risk","25 November, 2020","LONDON, Nov 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – As climate change brings more intense storms and rising seas, Britain faces rapidly growing and shifting flood threats – something few of those at risk are yet aware of, officials and insurers said on Friday. This lack of awareness – combined with fast-increasing demand for new housing, limited available land and often disjointed policymaking and regulation – mean efforts to keep people and property safe are struggling, they said. About 5.2 million homes and other properties in England are at risk of flooding – but only a third of people living in those areas believe they face a threat, said Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy for Britain’s Environment Agency. And fully two-thirds of properties in England rely on infrastructure – from roads and railways to power plants and water treatment plants – now menaced by flooding, she said during an event on flood risk at London Climate Action Week. Sea levels have risen about 16 cm (6 inches) in Britain since 1990, Foley said, making coastal areas more vulnerable to storm surges. And heavier rainfall is worsening surface floods away from rivers and shorelines, in places “where we never previously expected them”, as rain cannot run off fast enough, said Sean Walkden, property claims manager for British insurance firm NFU Mutual. Beverley Adams, head of catastrophe insurance for Marsh Risk Consulting and a member of the government’s flood roundtable, said her own home flooded this year because of blocked drains, even as she fielded flood-emergency calls from others for work. She has now become more vigilant about checking drains – but for others, particularly businesses, the problem will be harder to manage, she said. Owners of flood-prone homes in Britain can buy affordable insurance through Flood Re, a government and insurance industry initiative that shares the cost of flood risk across all home insurance policies sold. Businesses, however, do not have access to it – and, hit by more frequent and severe flooding, are finding it harder to find or afford coverage, if they ever had it, raising the prospect of growing company failures. Ian Bartholomew, co-founder of insurer FloodFlash, is stepping into that gap with a new product in Britain: parametric flood insurance, where the insurer and insured agree that if a flood hits a certain height, a pre-set payout will happen. A sensor is established on a building’s outside wall, and if triggered – and the flooding confirmed by means ranging from weather data to news or social media posts – a payout is rapidly issued. After storms Ciara and Dennis slammed Wales in February, drenched FloodFlash customers got payouts as soon as the next day, allowing them to quickly make repairs and reopen, Bartholomew said. With traditional insurance, which requires a claims visit, “it can be months, if not years, before people get their money”, he added. But in a world where flooding is likely to become much more frequent, quick recovery is crucial, said he and others, who are working towards a “flood on Friday, back up on Monday” model in a bid to keep businesses afloat. Bartholomew said such insurance offerings also give business owners an incentive to invest in pumps, flood-gates or other means of curbing damage to try to hold down premiums. Parametric flood insurance is so far available only to businesses, but might be one model to continue affordable home insurance after the scheduled end of the Flood Re programme in 2039, he added. The cost of flood insurance for homes in Britain is set to continue rising as climate change brings more severe rainfall and higher sea levels – but also as more homes are built on floodplains, planners said. Foley, of the Environment Agency, said the number of homes on floodplains in England was expected to double in the next 50 years. “We have huge pressures for growth in this country and government ambition to build more homes,” she said. “That presents us with a real dilemma.” Hugh Ellis, director of policy for the Town and Country Planning Association, which campaigns for reforms in Britain’s planning system, said increasingly relaxed planning permission rules meant more homes were going up in high-risk zones. The extent to which climate change planning and deregulated development were moving in opposite directions was “really quite extraordinary”, he said, noting he could see 60 new homes being built on a floodplain just from the window of his own house. Most local authorities “don’t plan for 50 to 100 years” in the future, and builders – with no liability for flood damage to homes they site – have no financial incentive to change their practices. “Their business model is not plugged into what might be called stewardship,” Ellis said. “I am absolutely sure we’d see a much better standard of development if developers had any liability.” Just as important, he said, many homeowners and communities do not want to discuss climate change and flood risks, fearing it might hurt their ability to get insurance or drive away buyers and investment. That is true even in extremely high-risk coastal communities which might eventually need to relocate, he said. “Honesty is not happening locally and politically,” he said. “The greatest failure in climate change, like in all disasters, is a failure to imagine… a future you can’t prepare for.” Effectively cutting flood risks will require everything from rethinking planning rules to pulling in architects and interior designers to consult on home flood-proofing designs that do not put off potential buyers, specialists said. “Aesthetics matter a lot to homeowners,” said Matthew Eagle, head of global model solutions for U.S.-based insurance firm Guy Carpenter. Standards are also needed for flood-protection work on homes and businesses – from flood-gates to self-closing air bricks – to ensure those who invest in lowering risk get something that works, said Nick Hill, a property claims lead for London-based insurer Aviva. “People can be left thinking they have good resilience when they don’t,” he added.

At nearby Bainbridge, the Ure river reached record levels, jumping from 0.92 metres to 4.07 metres in the space of 7 hours to early 02 November. On 02 November rescue teams were called out to rescue drivers trapped in vehicles in Denton, Morton on Swale, Skipton, Cattal, Carleton and Ripon. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service reported some homes were flooded in Grinton and Masham, where the Ure River jumped to a record high of 3.57 metres, above the minor flood stage of 2.8 metres In neighbouring Lancashire, flooding affected Lancaster and several villages in the Ribble Valley including Waddington, Sawley and Chipping.

Rosscarbery in County Cork recorded 53.4mm of rain reported in 24 hours to 25 August, while 86.2mm of rain fell at Cloonee Lake in Kerry during the same period. In Northern Ireland, the Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) said it responded to 28 flooding incidents in Newcastle, Maghera, Draperstown and Cookstown. The Shimna river broke its banks in County Down. Strong winds downed trees and power lines in England and Wales, leaving thousands without power. Storm Francis also brought heavy rainfall to parts of Wales. Lake Vyrnwy in Powys recorded 68.4 mm in 24 hours to 25 August. Several rivers broke their banks in North Wales, including the Glaslyn river at Beddgelert, which reached record highs on 25 August, reaching around 2.4 metres. Around 80 people were evacuated from their homes in areas of Bethesda, Abergwyngregyn, Llandygai and Beddgelert. Some roads were closed after heavy rain triggered a landslip near Bethesda. Elsewhere in Wales, rescue teams were searching 2 people believed to be missing in the Taff river near Cardiff on 25 August. Meanwhile in Carmarthenshire, several people were rescued after a campsite flooded early on 25 August.

"Europe – Storms Cause Flash Flooding and Landslides in UK, France and Italy","13 August, 2020","After days of high temperatures, heavy rainfall brought by summer storms has caused flooding and landslides in parts of the United Kingdom, France and Italy. This follows dramatic flash flooding in southern Spain after almost 50mm of rainfall fell in 1 hour. In the UK, flash flooding was reported in Scotland after heavy rainfall 11 to 12 August, 2020. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it received more than 1,000 emergency calls due to the severe weather. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said in a statement of 12 August: “Following heavy thunderstorms overnight SEPA has a number of Flood Alerts in place and Flood Warnings in Aberdeenshire, Angus and Tayside. Small watercourses responded rapidly to the intense rainfall and localised impacts from these watercourses and small river catchments have been reported in East Lothian, Fife, Perth, and Stonehaven. A number of properties have been flooded in all the areas mentioned and a number of schools and roads have also been closed due to these floods.” Authorities in Fife declared a “major incident” after flash floods caused severe damage across the region. Evacuations were carried out after a landslide near Kinghorn. Some of the worst of the flooding was in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, where the heavy rain is also thought to have triggered a landslide near which derailed a train. Three people died and 6 were injured in the derailment. British Transport Police said they will conduct an investigation into the cause of the incident. The capital Edinburgh recorded 43.2 mm of rain in 24 hours to 12 August. The small town of Inverbervie, around 10km south of Stonehaven, recorded 55.2 mm of rain during the same period. As of 13 August, minor flooding was also reported in parts of England, including in parts of Lancashire, Cheshire, Staffordhire, Shropshire and Gloucestershire. The village of Gnosall in Staffordshire recorded 94.8 mm of rain in 24 hours to 12 August. Six flood alerts are in place in England, all in the Midlands area. The UK’s Met Office have issued Yellow level warnings for thunderstorms across much of England until 17 August. UPDATE – Police have confirmed that three people, including the driver, have died after a passenger train derailed near Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire. Read more ➡️ https://t.co/FmX9p458Vf

Letting Rivers Run Wild Could Reduce UK Flooding – New Research,"9 June, 2020","The UK government currently spends £2.6 billion on flood defences in England, and that amount is set to double by 2026. Flooding in February 2020 showed how that’s likely to be a good investment, as climate change drives warmer and wetter weather each winter. But when it comes to managing rivers to prevent flooding in towns and cities downstream, we’re often our own worst enemy. After the second world war, Britain embarked on a mission to reconstruct its rivers. Workers cut ditches to drain moorland, making it suitable for livestock farming. Looping rivers which once wound lazily through floodplains – flooding these areas once every two years or so – were straightened into rigid channels. River beds were dredged to deepen them and banks excavated to make them steeper, an unnatural situation that takes routine management to maintain. The idea behind all of this was to reduce flooding by increasing the speed at which water moves downstream. But this also increased the power of rivers to move sediment. Gravels and cobbles dash along these modified and heavily managed rivers, accumulating where the water slows down, as it moves through towns and cities. Here, the river bed swells as sediment piles up, increasing local flood risk. Over 60% of the UK’s watercourses have been transformed in this way, changing the fundamental character of many British rivers – and the natural processes that would usually govern them – over just a few generations. In a new study, we found that doing nothing is often a better course of action for reducing flooding than these heavy handed attempts to mechanically alter rivers. We studied the River Caldew in Cumbria, which has caused three major floods in nearby Carlisle since 2010. Satellite data showed that straightening, deepening and embanking was common along the river between 2005 and 2016. Very little sediment was spotted in the river and across the floodplain, suggesting that almost all of it was being funnelled downstream towards Carlisle. During this time, the channel through the city was widened in the hope that this would cause flood water to spread out and lose energy. But this only increased the problem of sediment building up within the river, creating a shallower channel through Carlisle that’s prone to overflowing. Outside of the city, in parts where maintenance has been relaxed, the river has begun to return to a more natural state. Multiple “wandering” channels can now be seen alongside wide areas of deposited gravel. This is encouraging, as it suggests that the main river and its floodplain are reconnecting, allowing the sediment it transports to fall out of the channel and collect upstream. We found that rivers which are allowed to behave more naturally are better at locking up sediment upstream, rather than letting it accumulate in unnaturally high quantities in flood-prone towns and cities. If more rivers are allowed to behave naturally and develop this way, it could help reduce future flooding. This hands-off approach to managing rivers is also much cheaper than hard engineering and brings a wealth of environmental benefits with it. The wandering channel system that’s evolving on the River Caldew has the greatest variety of features and habitats across the entire watercourse. There are gravel bars, deep pools, floodplain wetlands, ponds and river cliffs. This diversity provides greater spawning habitat for fish, and cooler refuges for their fry. The open water habitats benefit amphibians, the trees and shrubs help kingfisher hunt and sand martins can nest in the river cliffs. Beetles and spiders scurry in the shingle, earning this wilder stretch of the Caldew a designation as a site of special scientific interest. The last 75 years have seen many UK rivers change beyond recognition. The way we manage them in future must look very different. Relaxing our iron grip and allowing natural processes to flourish on rivers once more could be our best hope for reducing flooding, while reviving lost ecosystems rich in native wildlife.

Perils Estimates Insured Losses for UK’s February Floods at US$367,"2 April, 2020","PERILS, the independent Zurich-based organisation providing industry-wide catastrophe insurance data, has disclosed its initial loss estimate for the floods in the United Kingdom in February 2020. The February 2020 Floods in the UK were the result of record-breaking rainfall on saturated grounds which led to extensive river flooding. Heavy rainfall was mainly associated with the three named storms of Ciara, Dennis and Jorge. River flooding affected the English regions of West Midlands, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber, as well as Wales and parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland. Based on claims data collected from affected insurance companies, PERILS’ initial estimate of the insured property market loss for the February 2020 UK Floods is GBP 297 million (US$367 million). While an estimated 4,800 properties were damaged, many other locations were successfully protected by flood defences. However, the resulting losses to the insurance industry were the largest for a flood event since the winter floods of December 2015 , which cost the industry GBP 1.1 billion (US$1.36 billion) at the time. Combined with the flood losses in November 2019 and losses from the 2019/2020 windstorm season, PERILS estimates that the UK insurance industry suffered a total loss of approximately GBP 650 million (US$804 million) from flood- and wind- related events during the 2019/2020 winter period.

Housebuilding Ban on Floodplains Isn’t Enough – Flood-Prone Communities Should Take Back Control,"28 February, 2020","February 2020 has brought more than its fair share of bad weather to the north of England, the Midlands and Wales. Shrewsbury, Bewdley and Telford swam in the Severn, while the Ouse invaded York. For some, the adage that it’s grim up north rang true. The recent flooding is a reminder that all parts of the UK are vulnerable to natural hazards, and the costs aren’t just economic. Flood water can enter a building in minutes, but the impact on communities can last years. Flooded homes and businesses take months to clean up and dry out, and the long-term impact on the health and relationships of those affected is often overlooked. Climate change has made some types of floods more likely, but past government policy has ensured that the ensuing crises are worse than they might otherwise have been. While there’s an urgent need for new homes, 1.8 million people currently live in areas at significant risk of flooding, and homes are still being built on floodplains. The chief executive of the Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, argued that if we must build in the floodplain, homes should be built with garages on the ground floor and living space upstairs, to ensure floods cause minimal damage. This might sound radical, but some of the oldest buildings along Britain’s rivers and coastline, such as millhouses and warehouses, have stone floors and steps up to first floor entrances. They were designed hundreds of years ago to ensure their occupants could ride out intermittent flooding. Climate change may force countries, such as the UK, to adopt radical practices from parts of the world that flood more frequently, such as houses that are designed to float when floods come, rising on stilts as the water rises. It’s an idea that is familiar to those living in stilt houses beside the Amazon river, and it’s also found favour in the Netherlands. For those who already live on the floodplain, there are less dramatic but important adaptations that can be made. Internally reinforced, mechanically sealable flood doors can be installed to keep water out. Carpets and wooden floorboards that soak up dirty flood waters can be swapped for waterproof concrete and stone-slab floors. Electrical sockets can be raised and non-return valves can be fitted to toilets to stop sewage filling homes when it floods. Making Britain more resilient to floods is not just a task for individuals. The government now has an opportunity to prove its long-term commitment to the north of England in particular, by creating detailed plans to increase resilience to floods. Backing the HS2 railway and moving the House of Lords out of London might grab headlines, but making sure the region is resilient in the face of future flooding requires less glamorous investment. It’s equally important that money isn’t just thrown at the areas that were flooded last – or which might have voted Conservative in the last election. Every flooded community, no matter where they are in the country, deserves support, and managing flood risk is about more than just installing large flood defences or water-proofing homes. A long-term approach requires policies that link the necessary changes in land use, agriculture, housing and development. Part of this could give communities the power to take control of their own destiny by creating regional flood forums, giving residents’ groups a say in how communities prepare for and respond to floods. Too many people are left with the impression that the government, or other distant authorities, can be trusted with sole responsibility for preventing flooding, and are then left feeling powerless and abandoned when floods happen. It’s essential that everyone who lives in or moves to an area at risk of flooding knows that the risk of flooding is real. It’s difficult to imagine that your home could be flooded if you have never seen water lapping at your front door or rising up your kitchen cabinets. This is especially true for those living in properties that don’t immediately border running water. But the historical record tells us that even before modern climate change, big floods have always happened. And floods are like buses, sometimes nothing happens for ages and then several come, one after the other. Flood risk maps exist, but the message is not getting through to those who need them. Perhaps flood risk should come to be seen like earthquake risk zones in other countries. It would mean public signs clearly positioned to show that you are in a flood zone and that there is danger to life, health and property. It would ensure that strong building regulations are adhered to and school lessons are specifically devoted to knowing how to keep people safe. We certainly need new ideas for connecting people with the realities of living with climate change. Ensuring that everyone can find out about their flood risk, shape decision-making on land management, and adapt their homes accordingly could empower people to prepare for the floods that will inevitably come.

UK – More Evacuations in England as Rivers Remain High,"27 February, 2020","Flooding has promoted more evacuations in parts of England as rivers remain high after heavy rain from storms Ciara and Dennis. Around 60 homes were evacuated in East Cowick and Snaith in East Yorkshire after the River Aire broke its banks. Humberside Police and Humberside Fire and Rescue Service said 52 homes in Snaith had been evacuated and 14 in East Cowick. East Riding of Yorkshire Council said 160 properties were at risk. The River Aire at nearby Chapel Haddlesey reached near record levels of 3.42 metres on 25 February. Flooding occurs in this area when the river is at 1.34 metres. Meanwhile flooding along the Severn River is still causing major problems in parts of the West Midlands. On 26 February, homes were evacuated in the Ironbridge area of Shropshire after flood barriers failed. Barriers have been holding back water from the swollen Severn River for around the last 10 days. The Environment Agency said flood water along the Wharfage in Ironbridge could get to 1.8 metres deep. As of early 27 February, the level of the River Severn at the nearby Buildwas Gauge was 6.50 metres and falling slowly. A peak level of 6.79 metres occurred on the morning of 26 February. The Severn has also overtopped flood defences in Bewdley, Worcestershire, about 45 km south. About 40 properties are thought to be either flooded or at risk. The Severn reached 5.48 metres during the evening of 26 February and appeared to be falling slowly on 27 February. The highest level recorded at this location is 5.56 metres on 02 November, 2000. Deputy Chief Constable Julian Moss, from West Mercia Police, said in a statement: “We would like to reassure everyone that the emergency multi-agency flood response is currently on-going within the villages and towns across Worcestershire and Shropshire and will remain in place for some time to come. “We also want to reassure people that whilst we are responding to dynamic and evolving situations in particular places, we recognise that there are many places that are still flooded and have been for some time. There are still teams on the ground in those places. “The multi-agency response is set to continue for the next ten days as the flood waters are set to recede quite slowly and are likely to be topped up again with additional rain over the weekend and at the end of next week. We would therefore ask people to take this into consideration when making accommodation arrangements for themselves and any pets or livestock. “We encourage everyone to heed the flood advice and remain vigilant around flood water.” Breaking NewsEngland",https://floodlist.com/europe/united-kingdom/uk-evacuations-england-floods-february-2020,0,,"3.42, 1.34, 1.8, 6.50, 6.79, 5.48, 5.56",,"East Yorkshire, East Riding, East Cowick, Bewdley, Worcestershire, England, Shropshire, West Mercia Police",False,True,True,OtherFlood + Numerics
‘Natural’ Flood Management Would Be Overwhelmed by Britain’s Winter Super-Floods,"21 February, 2020","As large swathes of the UK endure the worst floods in living memory, hearts and minds are rightly focused on protecting people and property. At one point the government’s Environment Agency had issued a record 594 flood warnings or alerts – its map of the country was a sea of orange and red symbols. Once the floods recede, there will doubtless be a period of reflection on what could have been done better. It may be tempting to point the finger of blame or to promote a particular solution. But the hard truth is that there is no silver bullet for “preventing” floods. There are common sense actions, like avoiding new development in places that are known to flood. Official statistics suggest that about 10% of new residential addresses are created in these high risk areas (classified as National Flood Zone 3). It is also smart to protect critical infrastructure like bridges or power substations to high standards. Yet a 2016 government review of flood resilience revealed more than 500 assets vulnerable to flooding. Other measures can help ensure that floods, when they do occur, are less devastating. These include paved floors, valves to shut off foul water, or raising electrical circuits. Who should pay for these is another matter. However, we need to accept that the climate is changing, and with it the pattern and types of river flooding. For instance, the Met Office has charted a steady decline in the number and severity of substantial snowfall events since the 1960s. Less snow means subsequent spring melting is becoming rarer. Instead, the country is seeing more heavy rainfall, with winter records being broken on a regular basis. Or consider how a warmer Atlantic boosted the intensity of Storm Desmond in December 2015 by 25%. Desmond set the UK’s 24hr rainfall record and caused severe flooding across much of northern England. These consequences are exactly what the climate models have been predicting for decades. The net result is more water flowing from the headwaters of rivers in shorter periods. We are also observing simultaneous flooding across many river basins on a regular basis – the period since the late 1990s has been especially flood-rich. We aren’t going to halt or reverse climate change anytime soon. However there are some technical solutions that might help reduce (note “reduce” not “prevent”) the risk of flooding. First, we will need to build new flood and coastal defences to higher standards to cope with climate change. Second, we’ll need state-of-the art forecasts that can zoom right in and predict the risk of flooding from street to street. These next generation systems will warn at risk communities and businesses, and could help emergency services to navigate flooded road networks. But many, including the government, are now promoting the wider uptake of “natural” flood management. This refers to various techniques intended to retain water or slow it down, or store it in floodplains without causing harm. Examples of natural flood management include: soil conservation, which means more water soaks into the ground rather than staying on the surface; adding large wood debris to river channels and building “leaky” dams to delay the flow from upland streams; wetland creation, urban ponds, and setback of flood embankments to make space to store excess water. There may also be wider environmental benefits such as tree planting, habitat creation or carbon sequestration in new forests and re-wetted uplands. This all sounds very appealing and is the subject of ongoing research. Unfortunately, when we worked on the most comprehensive meta-analysis of natural flood management to date we concluded that such techniques are useful for reducing nuisance floods but would be overwhelmed by the types of super-floods seen in the UK this winter. Throw a month’s worth of rain on a saturated catchment in one weekend and no nature-based solution is going to hold back the water. Given large UK river basins generally host various buildings, roads, many different types of fields and so on, it is also impossible to detect exactly what portion of changes in observed flood risk can be attributed to a patchwork of leaky dams, soil conservation and so forth. This is also very difficult even within modelled worlds. We don’t want to discourage natural flood management, but we need more candour about its capabilities. Given the challenges posed by climate and landscape changes, we should be drawing on the full tool kit. Raising hopes of flood “prevention” by nature-based solutions will only lead to disappointment. They have a place, but only within a much broader, coordinated set of responses.

"UK – Over 1,600 Homes Flooded After Storm Dennis","21 February, 2020","Over 1,650 homes have been flooded in England and Wales after heavy rain from Storm Dennis. Rivers reached record levels and wide areas of England and parts of South Wales are still flooded. Media reported at least 5 people died in the storm, including one person who died in flood waters from the River Teme near Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire on 16 February. The Environment Agency in England said that, as of 19 February, 645 properties in England had been flooded, including 200 homes in Worcestershire. The Environment Agency said 24,725 homes had been protected from flooding. This follows the damage caused by Storm Ciara, where 550 homes were flooded, mostly in areas of northern England, with around 12,000 homes protected. Meanwhile in South Wales the local authority in Rhondda Cynon Taf said that approximately 1,000 homes and businesses have been significantly impacted by flooding in the region. The Association of British Insurers has issued guidance on how home insurance companies will respond in an emergency situation where a home has been flooded. The ABI (Association of British Insurers) is reassuring homeowners and businesses that have suffered flood and storm damage that insurers will be doing all they can to help them recover as quickly as possible, and has issued guidance on dealing with flood damage and insurance.

UK – Insurers Offer Advice on Recovery After Storm Dennis Floods,"20 February, 2020","In the aftermath of Storm Dennis, which has flooded over 1,6000 homes in England and South Wales, a British insurance organisation is reassuring homeowners and businesses that have suffered flood and storm damage that insurers will be doing all they can to help them recover as quickly as possible. According to advice from the Association of British Insurers (ABI), insurance customers should contact their home or commercial insurer, with most having 24-hour emergency helplines to help get claims moving as quickly as possible. Where needed, they will bring in extra resources to handle claims. Homeowners concerned about being able to get future flood insurance, can be reassured that the industry developed Flood Re scheme means that they should be able to obtain affordable flood insurance. The ABI said that, with masses of personal possessions ruined or damaged by the flooding, insurers do not want to hold up the recovery process by delaying the removal of flood damaged items. It will help the insurance claims process to have as much detail as possible about items which have been ruined, but insurers do not expect customers to keep piles of damaged belongings, so once you’ve spoken to your insurer you can: Many drying and restoration companies can fully restore water damaged items, so if you are able to store them in the garden it may be worth keeping them for inspection and repair if possible. Laura Hughes, Manager, General Insurance, Association of British Insurers, said: “Storm Dennis followed hot on the heels of Storm Ciara, and insurers were ready for it. Their first priority is to help those homeowners and businesses who have suffered damage recover as quickly as possible. This will include making emergency payments and arranging temporary alternative accommodation if needed.” “Thanks to the Flood Re scheme devised by the industry, affordably priced flood insurance remains available to those households at high flood risk.” The ABI also points out that: See the full guidance from the ABI on responding to major floods here (pdf).",https://floodlist.com/insurance/uk/insurers-recovery-storm-dennis-floods-february-2020,0,,,"Dennis, Dennis, Ciara","England, South Wales",False,False,False,OtherFlood (no numerics)
UK – Evacuations After Storm Dennis Triggers Major Flooding in England and Wales,"17 February, 2020","Heavy rain brought by Storm Dennis has caused flooding across the United Kingdom, with rivers reaching record levels in England and Wales. Storm Dennis is the second severe storm to hit the country in the last few days. Ground was already saturated by heavy rainfall from Storm Ciara, which caused severe flooding in northern England on 09 February. Winds from Storm Dennis reached over 140 km/h on 15 February. Flights were cancelled and public transport disrupted. Rough seas claimed the lives of 2 people on England’s South East Coast on the same day. The UK’s Met Office said that Crai Reservoir in Powys, South Wales, recorded 157.6 mm of rain in 48 hours to 16 February, which is the equivalent of a month’s worth of rain. John Curtin, Executive Director of Flood and Coastal Risk Management at the Environment Agency said via Social Media the that rainfall levels from Storm Dennis were high but not exceptional and the current flooding is also a result of saturated ground conditions left by Storm Ciara. Rivers in Wales and England’s West Midlands broke their banks, prompting evacuations and leaving some communities cut off. Army personnel and Red Cross have been assisting in affected areas, along with police, fire and emergency services, the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales. A record high number of flood warnings or alerts have been issued for England. As of 17 February, there were 5 severe flood warnings, 282 warnings and 347 alerts. The severe flood warnings were all for areas in the West Midlands. Areas of South Wales saw some of the worst of the flooding over the weekend 15 to 16 February. South Wales Police said “Hundreds of houses have been checked and searched by fire and rescue officers, and hundreds of people have been rescued from their homes. “They have been looked after at one of seven rescue centres which have been set up by local authorities across Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil. “The most severe impact was upon Rhondda Cynon Taff, and more specifically the Taff valley, which experienced multiple floods and landslides.” Two severe flood warnings were issued: one for the River Taff at Pontypridd and the River Neath at Aberdulais. The River Taff burst its banks in areas around Pontypridd, flooding streets, damaging homes and submerging cars. The Taff reached record highs of 5.324 metres at Upper Boat Bridge on 16 February. One person died after falling into the overflowing Tawe River in Ystradgynlais in Powys. Parts of Crickhowell were flooded after the river Ursk reached 4.508 metres on 16 February. Residents of Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, were advised to evacuate due to the flooding. Flooding has also affected parts of western England, with the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Worcestershire declaring a “major incident”. Roads have been closed and some areas evacuated. Worcestershire County Council said: “Areas of Worcestershire continue to experience flooding with many roads closed across the county. Although in some areas river levels are dropping, they are set to rise again over the next few hours, peaking during the evening.” One woman is missing after being swept away by the River Teme near Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire on 16 February. Around 130 properties have been flooded in the town, prompting at least 20 people to evacuate. Levels of the Teme reached 5.9 metres on 16 February, well above flood stage of 4.55m. In Herefordshire, the River Wye reached a record level of 6.09 metres at Hereford Old Bridge on 17 February. Residents in the Blackmarstone have been told to evacuate. In Shropshire, around 30 properties have been flooding in Ludlow, where the River Teme reached close to record levels of 5.2 metres on 16 February. Minor flood stage here is 3 metres.

UK and Ireland – Rivers Overflow After Heavy Rain From Storm Ciara,"10 February, 2020","Heavy rain from Storm Ciara has triggered flooding in northern England, parts of Scotland and Ireland. Some rivers in northern England have reached record levels. Meanwhile strong winds of up to 150km/h from Storm Ciara – known as Sabine in Germany and Switzerland and Elsa in Norway – has left thousands of homes without power, and caused hundreds of flights to be grounded and rail services cancelled in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK. In England, the Environment Agency said that “Storm Ciara brought high winds and heavy rain to much of England over the weekend, with some parts of Cumbria receiving nearly three quarters of February’s rain in just 24 hours, leading to rivers bursting their banks. There are currently around 550 properties believed to have been affected by flooding as a result of the severe weather. However, approximately 26,000 have been protected by flood defences across England.” Initial figures suggest that areas of the Lake District recorded 179.8mm of rain in a 24 hour period. Levels of the Calder, Ribble and Irwell rivers jumped to highest or second highest on record. At one point there were 263 flood warnings and 1 severe flood warning in place. This number has since fallen to 97 flood warnings and 204 flood alerts. Properties were flooded in parts of Todmorden and Hebden Bridge in the Calder Valley, West Yorkshire. Flood rescues were carried out in Appleby in Cumbria and in the Ribble Valley and areas around Blackpool, Lancashire. Meanwhile the overflowing River Irwell prompted some evacuations in Greater Manchester, including Bury. In Scotland, part of a building collapsed as a result of fast-flowing water of the Teviot River in Hawick. Areas of Dumfries were flooded after the River Nith burst its banks. In Ireland, high waves combined with high tide caused some coastal flooding in areas around Dublin (in particular Sutton) on 09 February. Heavy rainfall in parts of the country triggered minor flooding on roads, with some of the worst reported near Ballymote, County Sligo and near Inagh in County Clare. #Mytholmroyd in devastation.

Flash Flooding Is a Serious Threat in the UK – Here’s How Scientists Are Tackling Its Prediction,"14 December, 2019","It’s becoming a familiar scene on the news: sodden British people wading through streets up to their knees in flood water. From Stirling to Sheffield, many parts of the UK in 2019 felt the impact of severe surface water flooding – often referred to as flash flooding – that followed torrential rain. As the climate changes and the UK experiences more intense summer storms, this is becoming an increasingly important issue. Surface water flooding is what happens in built-up areas when heavy rainfall has nowhere to go. Unable to enter a watercourse or drainage system, the water instead flows over the ground causing flash flooding. Increased development means more areas are paved over, leaving fewer places for rainfall to drain away. And more frequent heavy rains overload the sewer and drainage network, which makes flash flooding more likely. James Bevan, chief executive of the England and Wales Environment Agency, said this kind of flooding “threatens more people and properties than any other form of flood risk”. In 2016, the UK government included surface water flooding on the national risk register. Unlike river and coastal flooding, which can be widespread (as was seen in November 2019 across parts of northern England), surface water flooding presents unique challenges because it’s difficult to predict the location, timing and impact of what are typically localised events. As the climate changes and urban populations grow, the number of people at risk of surface water flooding increases. This risk is particularly high in Scotland with over 100,000 properties identified at risk from flash floods. And for many people, even if their home or business is not at risk, there’s a good chance the roads or railway lines they use are. Although Scotland’s river and coastal flooding warning systems are well established, surface water alerting is still in its infancy. To address this gap, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is continually developing its flood forecasting service with the Flood Warning Development Framework for 2017-21, which aims to explore and test innovative ways to warn people about flash floods. Developing an effective forecasting system requires hydrological models that represent surface run-off, inundation and water movement, showing how water travels via surface and urban sewerage and drainage networks. Prediction models are also needed to quantify uncertainty in forecasting the rainfall that causes surface water flooding. The uncertain nature of intense storms means that heavy rainfall can happen without much warning. This coupled with the pressure that excess natural run-off puts on man-made drainage networks when there are fewer places for water to go, makes surface water flooding forecasting a real challenge. It’s a particularly acute problem in Scotland where the climate and geography contribute to the high uncertainties around predicting the location and timing of flooding. A 2016 study found the most dangerous flash floods in the UK include those that resulted from rapidly developing thunderstorm systems. Such storms can result in sudden and dangerous flooding in urban areas – yet these are the most challenging weather systems for flood forecasters to predict. In the past five years, there has been a rapid development of thunderstorm numerical weather prediction computer models and advances in what is called probabilistic ensemble forecasting. This means instead of making a single forecast of the most likely weather, a set (or ensemble) of forecasts is produced, giving an indication of the range of possible weather ahead. Combined with an increase in computing power and skill, it is now becoming feasible to develop flash flood forecasting systems for urban areas. Earlier this year, we were commissioned by SEPA to review the state of the science behind surface water flood forecasting in Scotland. Based on an extensive review of published research and reports, coupled with discussions with industry experts, we show that recent advances in computing, thunderstorm models, ensemble forecasting and surface water modelling mean that it is possible for SEPA to explore and build on the accumulated global knowledge about flash flood forecasting. The risk of surface water flooding in Scotland is communicated through SEPA’s Flood Guidance Statement and Flood Alerts, where assessment is based on predetermined rainfall amount and duration thresholds and local expert knowledge. This helped to provide the UK’s first surface water flood risk forecasts for each of the big sporting events at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. This information is useful to emergency services and the public, but the ability to provide detailed information on the location and timing of flash flooding remains limited. SEPA’s review highlights the growing need to provide more focused forecasts to help those concerned make the right decisions. It also identifies opportunities to learn how other countries respond to similar flooding that could be applied to Scotland. The review provides several examples of initiatives that could improve the monitoring of flash flood impacts, including better use of crowdsourced data, as happens in the Netherlands, and better weather forecast visualisation tools (such as 3-D interactive displays and animations) as demonstrated in Spain. It may never be possible to prevent flash flooding, but reliable and early forecasting can help improve the capacity to prepare, respond and recover. The recent introduction of thunderstorm models and ensemble forecasting has resulted in significant advances in forecasting rainfall. This means it may now be possible to forecast flash flooding in urban areas, as well as make forecasts and warnings more focused and easier to understand, which in turn will help people make better, more informed decisions. Producing flood forecasts for any particular location is likely to remain challenging beyond a few hours in advance – there will always be limits to the predictability of extreme rainfall. But our capacity to predict extreme weather is constantly improving, which SEPA may be able to apply to surface water flood forecasting. Solutions for communicating uncertainty of heavy rainfall forecasts continue to develop. Our work means that a step-change in flash flood forecasting that builds on the experience of SEPA, the rest of the UK and other countries, is now possible. Making the best use of all available data – including social media and crowdsourced data – will increase awareness of flash flooding and help communities prepare and respond more effectively.

How England’s Broken Planning System Has Created (Not Reduced) the Risk of Floods,"23 November, 2019","Recent floods in England have been described as unprecedented or even “biblical” events, often with the misguided assumption that they were unavoidable or unpredictable. That is not the case. Over the past few decades, development practice in England has led to more than 300,000 homes being built in high flood risk areas. In this sense, the planning system has actually created (not reduced) flood risk. The flooding in northern England was indeed extensive, with about 500 homes flooded and more than 1,000 properties evacuated in Doncaster, and major transport disruption across several counties. Subsequent media coverage did highlight the many ways that flooding can be stopped, but key articles tended to focus on typically capital-intensive solutions: flood walls, river embankments, demountable flood barriers or dredging (the benefits of which are highly debatable). The overarching message was that these events are unpredictable and unprecedented, and the only way to properly deal with them is to invest millions in large physical infrastructure. While these are helpful suggestions, they only address part of the problem. There is another root cause of flooding that appears not to get so much airtime, namely the role of a fractured planning system that still enables developers to build homes in high flood risk areas. Urban planning in England is highly regulated and has often been accused of constraining development or in some cases stymieing private sector investments. A 2006 government policy statement attempted to direct development away from areas at highest risk – in simple terms, the intention was to promote building appropriate things in appropriate locations. However, in 2012, the then coalition government published a new National Planning Policy Framework for England, which replaced existing policy and meant there was no longer clear guidance to prevent building in flood plains. To complicate matters further, the Growth and Infrastructure Act in 2013 released large areas of greenfield land for development. The act effectively gave developers a right to submit major planning applications directly to central government and thus proposals and decisions could evade not only communities but also local planning authorities. As a result of these legislative changes, there is now a better chance of vulnerable homes being built in flood-prone areas. So how has this policy landscape impacted the number of homes/apartments (typically referred to as “dwellings” in government data) being build in flood risk areas? The below table shows numbers of new dwellings built between 1989 and 2016 within areas of high flood risk (technically Flood Zone 3: “floodplains” with a one in 100-year return period and “coastal areas” with a one in 200-year return period). The average proportion of new dwellings built in areas of high flood risk has fluctuated annually between 7% and 11% with some regions such as London, Yorkshire and Humber, and the East Midlands regularly surpassing these averages. This adds up to more than 300,000 new homes being built since 1989 that are at risk of flooding. Despite a plethora of guidance for planners and apparent restrictions on developers, this building persists. Over this period, the continued “free-market” development of flood plains in England has had an unexpected effect. Developers have increasingly been using flood plains to build social housing for low income families, homes for the elderly/disabled as well as schools and hospitals. One 2009 study identified 2,374 schools and 89 hospitals in flood prone areas of England. Planning policy has thus caused some of the most vulnerable members of society to occupy highly flood-prone areas. Urban areas have been creating flood risk. And this is largely due to the government’s focus on making land – low cost, flood prone land – available for development. Therefore, when considering “extreme” flood events and the highly expensive defence and protection solutions, we should not lose sight of how government policies have consistently created more risk – in England, at least. To see how different things could be, just compare England to Scotland. North of the border, flood policy is controlled separately by the devolved government, which tends to deal with the risk rather better.

Why Flooding Is Still So Difficult to Predict and Prepare for,"19 November, 2019","Before you read this story, take a minute to stop and look around you. Now imagine your surroundings under two feet of dirty, sewage-filled water. If you’re at home, everything is trashed. Never mind your car, your furniture or washing machine. They will be ruined, but those things can be replaced. Think of your wedding album, soaked and spoiled. The music box your grandmother gave you, full of stinking mud. That is the reality of being flooded. And sadly, it’s a reality that many people in the UK – in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire – have faced in the recent floods. Tragically, floodwater can also be life-threatening. Given the huge costs to people and property when it floods, it’s a reasonable question to ask why, in one of the richest countries in the world, more cannot be done to prevent flooding. And if not prevent it, to know more precisely when and where it will hit. As a hydrologist and a flood and hazard forecaster, I spend my life doing just that. And despite the work of some of the brightest scientists, the world’s most advanced supercomputers and the commitment of hardworking people on the ground, floods are just difficult beasts to pin down. And if you’ve ever thought that your home could never be affected, you should know that floods can happen almost anywhere, at any time. Some of the most wonderful aspects of the UK – the changeable weather and spectacular landscape – are also what makes the country so susceptible to flooding. When beautiful river valleys and low-lying plains – as well as cities and urban areas – are inundated with persistent rain, sudden downpours or high tides with storms, flooding can quickly follow. Especially if there is an unexpected fault in the infrastructure designed to hold back water or prevent flooding, as was seen at Whaley Bridge in Yorkshire in August 2019. In Doncaster in early November 2019, only a slight variation in a fairly typical weather system was enough to cause flooding. Cold and warm air masses regularly press against each other close to North America, creating an Atlantic storm factory. These weather systems are often fired towards Europe too by the strength and direction of the jet stream. Damp ground in the north of England is also par for the course. But add one heavy downpour, caused by a rotating weather front getting “stuck” over one area – and you have a flood. Weather predictions have come a long way in the past few decades – today’s three-day forecast is as accurate as a 24-hour forecast was in the 1990s. But they are never perfect. Multiply all the uncertainty within the weather forecast with all the complexity of modelling the path of water travelling through the landscape – both above and below ground – then you start to get an idea of the difficulties forecasters face. We have to take account of all the different routes through the landscape that a single raindrop might take. There are billions upon billions of different possibilities. It requires lots of assumptions. Many people in flood-hit areas have said that the floods are unprecedented. Older residents have said they have never seen anything like it. But we must remember our landscape is thousands – even millions – of years old. We need to think about much longer timescales than single human lifespans. And of course on top of this, the landscape and climate are changing – so even the best historic data don’t provide a good proxy of the future. Fishlake may not have flooded in recent years, but it is right on the floodplain of the River Don. Its watery name is probably no coincidence. Neither is that of Meadowhall, the shopping centre in Sheffield, more than likely built on a flood meadow. On November 8, it was marooned. But people tend to like living by the river – and they don’t associate a beautiful riverside development with dirty water and destroyed wedding photos. Flooding is hard to predict and prepare for. But floods happen. They always have – and we know that as the global climate warms due to human activity we are likely to see more of some types of flood in Britain. It’s hard to convince people who don’t know they are at risk that they should prepare for the worst. This is where the government must step in. To better prepare for floods, we need difficult, expensive, but rational decision-making on flood defences. That would mean seriously considering the risk of building homes and businesses in the floodplain, and planning away from these areas as much as possible. If there is no other option, then the flood-proof design standards must be substantially higher. Developers must also be held to account for ensuring these standards are met and householders must be made fully aware of the risks. Forecasts and communications of flood risks can always be improved, and my colleagues and I will be working hard on it for years to come. But residents, farmers and businesses can’t be expected to face off the problem of floods on their own.

Flood Survivors Should Be Given Proper Support – Instead They’re Told to Get ‘Resilient,"19 November, 2019","After severe flooding in the North of England, many affected residents have been left feeling let down and left behind by the systems in place to protect them. Our research suggests that they, and many other communities affected by flooding in the past, have good reason to feel this way. Often, the effects of flooding are not fair – and government policy isn’t helping. Current methods of modelling, managing and protecting against flood risk are socially blind, and end up disadvantaging the people and places that are most vulnerable. In recent years, flood management policy across the world has focused investment on technology to better assess which areas are at risk of flooding, and what the damage could be. This technical expertise can then be used to inform vulnerable people, guide development, and determine priority areas for flood defences. Undoubtedly, innovation in flood risk assessments over the last two decades has aided decision-making for central government agencies and local authorities. We have a much better, if still far from perfect, understanding of the movement of water through catchments, urban drainage systems, streets and buildings. But this approach has limitations. For a start, flood maps tend to be static snapshots that are only periodically updated. In reality, risk can change quickly. As the climate crisis increases the frequency and severity of flooding, and urbanisation reduces the land’s capacity to absorb water, people may be surprised to learn that houses they bought many years ago are now at risk – not because they moved to a flood-prone area, but because the flood zone moved to them. More importantly, these technical models typically treat flood-prone areas as uniform entities that are simplistically labelled as at high, medium, or low risk. In turn, government policy across Europe and beyond increasingly expects people at risk to assume more responsibility for managing it, usually referring to this as becoming resilient. For example, the UK government encourages the public to check their postcode on simplified versions of flood maps, to inform choices on insurance or house purchases, increase their awareness of risk, and be prepared if in a higher-risk area. But people have very different capacities to make use of this information. For example, those with lower incomes may be less able to protect, repair or insure their properties, meaning they feel the effects of flooding much more acutely. Some people are also more vulnerable than others in ways that may not be immediately obvious. Extreme weather events are likely to have a greater effect on older people and those with health problems. Those with limited mobility are less able to evacuate from a flooded area or move possessions away in expectation of a flood. More broadly, the varying economic health of areas entrenches inequality in vulnerability to flooding. Put simply, people from more deprived areas that are prone to flooding may not only be more vulnerable to its effects, but are often less able to lobby for flood defences or media attention than those in wealthier areas. They also have fewer means to leave flood prone areas for a safer place to live. The often overlooked yet troubling irony is that globally it is those who have contributed least to the causes of flooding and have the least capacity to adapt that are most at risk. And of course, flooding rarely happens just once in an area – people and places can be trapped in cycles of flooding, further exacerbating inequality and disadvantage. Decisions about where to invest in flood defences are also problematic. They are usually based on simple cost-benefit analyses, which means that assessments of how many people might be protected and the value of protected assets rule decision-making processes. Many analyses have some degree of social weighting to ensure that wealthy areas with higher house prices or areas with larger populations do not monopolise finite budgets. But only rarely are more fine-grained social circumstances, such as people’s ability to escape from rising water and their capacity to deal with the consequences of a flood, integrated into decision-making. In response, flood risk management researchers and professionals increasingly argue for more engagement and collaboration with those at risk. But even here, there is a risk that the simple provision of more opportunities to participate could favour those with resources, expertise and time – the very same people who are arguably already well represented in the processes of public decision-making. That is not to criticise vocal and well organised community participation. Such participation is essential and must be supported. But to truly realise social and environmental justice and prevent communities suffering in silence, targeted outreach is needed. This could include recruiting independent support workers who can be community advocates for vulnerable neighbourhoods, and helping establish local flood action groups to liaise between authorities and the wider public. There are ways to make flooding fairer. Public authorities sit on a vast wealth of social, economic and demographic data that should be fully integrated with flood risk management decision-making, and regularly updated. The mapping tools to overlay these data with flood maps already exist, but there is concern that these are not being widely used. Flood risk managers and emergency first responders should also do more to understand these nuances. They could, for example, expand recent efforts to help communities develop their own specific flood response plans, use their local knowledge to identify the most vulnerable people, and determine ahead of time how they can be supported when flood warnings are issued. Finally, we need to recognise that fairness in flooding is linked to broader economic and social conditions. Austerity politics and funding cuts to local services can severely compromise people’s ability to deal with flooding. In the UK, spending on flood defences has fallen well shy of the pre-austerity trend – and this is sure to have impacted residents in the North of England. Our ongoing work shows that many communities affected by flooding feel ignored long before rising waters destroy their homes, businesses and neighbourhoods. Those most vulnerable to flooding must be given the resources to respond to it, rather than being told that it’s their responsibility to get resilient. This support is not only needed before and during flooding events, but also for the longer-term effects that are often only apparent weeks and months after waters have subsided. Just as our assessment of flood risk is getting more sophisticated, so must our management of it.

UK – 100 Rescued After Floods Hit Central and Eastern Areas of England,"18 November, 2019","More rivers have flooded in England after further heavy rain, affecting parts of Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Gloucestershire, as well as areas of eastern England. Meanwhile villages in South Yorkshire are still underwater after rivers overflowed earlier this month. The Environment Agency (EA), emergency responders and local authorities said they are helping to protect people and properties following flooding in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Gloucestershire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. Around 22,000 properties have been protected by flood defences, including nearly 7,000 properties in Yorkshire. As of 16 November there were nearly 400 operational staff working on flooded sites across the country pumping water and erecting temporary barriers to help better protect more homes and businesses against further flooding. The EA deployed 83 high volume pumps, including four ultra-high volume units, extracting water to help protect homes and businesses in South Yorkshire and the Midlands. Following the floods in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire that began on 07 November, further heavy rain from 14 November caused the Severn and Avon rivers to burst their banks, flooding parts of Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Gloucestershire. Flood barriers were erected in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, and Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. Herefordshire and Worcestershire Fire and Rescue Service said they attended 46 incidents of vehicles trapped in flood water and rescued 97 people between 14 and 15 November. One of the hardest hit areas was Evesham in Worcestershire, where the River Avon burst its banks. Schools and a hospital were closed. On 15 November levels of the Avon at Evesham reached 4 metres. Flood level here is 2.5 metres. The city of Worcester, about 25km north west, was also flooded after the Severn river overflowed. Dave Throup, Environment Agency manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, said via Social Media that this was the fourth time this year parts of Worcester have been flooded. The River Severn also caused flooding in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, with the river reaching 1.2 metres above flood alert level on 16 November. About 25km south of Worcester, the town of Tewkesbury was once again flooded. Tewkesbury stands at the confluence of the Avon and Severn rivers, which broke their banks and flooded the town in late October this year. In the east of England, St Ives in Cambridgeshire was surrounded by flood water after the River Great Ouse overflowed. Bardney, near Lincoln, flooded after the Barlings Eau burst its banks. The Environment Agency is urging communities to remain vigilant against the threat of flooding with flood warnings and alerts remaining in place across the country. Flooding is expected to cause continued disruption to communities in South Yorkshire, and parts of Lincolnshire and the north Midlands into this week. The EA said areas of Gloucestershire around the River Severn, and near the River Avon in Worcestershire and Warwickshire are expected to be affected by flooding until Monday. The UK’s Met Office said its weather station in Sheffield, South Yorkshire had recorded its wettest ever autumn. Via Social Media, the Office said: “With 15 days still to go, the site has already recorded 427.6mm of rain.

UK – Insurance Losses From Northern England Floods Could Reach $250 Million,"14 November, 2019","Parts of northern and central England saw a month’s worth of rain fall in 24 hours on 07 November, 2019. Rivers broke their banks and the ensuing floods have caused significant damage, with more than 500 properties flooded and 1,200 households evacuated. Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said in a statement of 13 November that the floods could lead to $250 million (£120 million) in insurance losses. Mohammad Khan, general insurance leader at PwC, said: “This is clearly a very difficult time for those who have been impacted by the floods. However, the UK insurance industry is better prepared for the floods that have occurred and is responding as quickly as possible to ensure that affected policyholders are having their needs met. “Due to the number of significant floods that have unfortunately occurred since the flood in 2007, the industry is much better prepared in helping affected policyholders quickly in dealing with this extreme weather. “Although it is still early to estimate the full losses from these floods, the losses to date could see the insurance industry paying out between £80m and £120m in claims for both people’s homes and affected businesses. This estimate could rise over the coming days depending on how much further rain falls over the rest of the week.” England",https://floodlist.com/insurance/uk/insurance-losses-northern-england-floods-november-2019,0,,"80, 120",,"England, UK",False,True,True,OtherFlood + Numerics
Flood Defences Simply Aren’t Good Enough – Here’s What Needs to Be Done,"12 November, 2019","Flood defences simply aren’t good enough – here’s what needs to be done, by Liz Sharp, University of Sheffield, for The Conversation. When even Boris Johnson, the UK’s Conservative prime minister, interprets severe flooding as a probable consequence of climate change, it’s a sign that everyone is recognising that the weather is becoming weird. It’s hard not to – the recent UK floods were prompted when the average rainfall for the entire month of November fell in South Yorkshire and north Derbyshire in 24 hours. The damage from the floods is still being assessed, but roads and rail lines were closed, people were stranded, hundreds of properties were inundated, and one woman lost her life. With the promise of more periods of intense rainfall in years to come, what needs to be done to protect communities from more flooding in future? Johnson stressed that the UK government is already investing in more flood defences. But while such investment is undoubtedly needed, it should not solely be directed to flood defence. Such strategies are focused on protecting high value property, and hence tend to neglect poorer communities. Flood defences – flood walls, barriers, overflow flood channels, and the like – protect particular localities against rising flood waters. As residents from Doncaster rightly argued in relation to new defences in Sheffield, flood defences protect one location by channelling water and flow towards another. So while flood defences are important and useful for protecting the assets we value most, it is important to consider their wider consequences. A comprehensive approach to flood risk involves a different form of investment – focusing on slowing the flow and protecting at-risk properties from water. Whereas flood defence will only help particular communities, investments that reduce the extent of flooding by slowing the flow can help everyone downstream. Over the past ten years, huge changes have been made in relation to the understanding and use of natural flood management. In the past we have tended to regard uplands as wasted land, in need of drainage so that they can be used for agriculture, for example. But uplands are now recognised to have an important function in holding the water back. Drainage ditches and other features enabling agricultural use can be removed and replaced by small dams and other natural flood risk management measures to enrich our naturally wet upland ecosystems and to slow the flow. But for now, this is only happening in select few places and needs to be more widespread. And by re-wetting uplands we also increase the extent of peatlands, hence helping carbon storage too. It is also important to slow the flow in urban areas. Councils are increasingly recognising that they can use parts of parks to do so. Sections of road or pavement can also be reclaimed for flood storage, and sometimes for infiltrating flood waters to the ground. Of course, this means that land currently used in one way must be partially or completely given up for other uses – a football field might be sacrificed for occasional flood storage; parking spots lost for a new rain garden. We can also make private choices that help to slow the flow. Is your roof water channelled into a rain-barrel, for example, and does this overflow into a wet part of your garden, or into the sewer? Though no single householder can make a big difference to the total flow, all householders acting together can make a difference. There are many beneficiaries of such changes – councils, water companies who treat the sewage and downstream residents. But at present it is nobody’s responsibility to look at these benefits together and incentivise changes to water management on private land. As the climate changes it is going to be even harder to avoid floods, so it’s also crucial that those who live in flood-prone places prepare. There is often great demand for local councils to supply sandbags at times of flooding, but sandbags are actually relatively ineffective compared to flood gates and other simple flood resilience measures that can be crucial in protecting homes from small floods. Careful interior design also reduces the harm caused by floods. Plug sockets can be placed halfway up the wall, for example, and it can be ensured that ground floors are made of materials that easily washed down, such as concrete or tiles, rather than fitted carpets or wood that will need to be thrown out. People living in locations at risk of flooding should also sign up for flood warnings, and each household should have a flood plan – a clear idea about what needs to done if there is a flood warning and limited time available to protect your family and your possessions. One of the difficulties of making these changes happen is that it means a new sort of water management, concerned not only with managing water but also partnering with the public. Engineers who predict floods and build defences are still needed, but to stimulate change in the practices of landowners, businesses and households, new listening, communication and coordination skills are paramount. It’s not yet clear how society can be stimulated to better manage flooding, and councils, water companies and the Environment Agency need to invest in new skills to lead this process of learning. In order to help such collaboration, my team is currently undertaking research to look at how mobilisation in relation to water is organised. Of course, all of this is will be of limited comfort to the poor people of Fishlake and other Yorkshire towns returning to their flood-ravaged homes. Flood vulnerable locations are often occupied by less wealthy members of our society. Evidence from Hull and other locations flooded in 2007 indicate that it will take many months if not years for people’s lives to return to normal, and that for some, the floods will take a significant toll on their mental and physical health. The flood authorities cannot promise to protect everyone from flooding. But the recent floods make it crystal clear that more must be done to address flood risks, both by improving natural flood defences and slowing the flow, and by catalysing and supporting everyone in flood risk zones to protect their homes. Because Johnson is right in saying that such floods will only become more common, and the government’s current approach simply isn’t good enough.

UK – Evacuations After Heavy Rain and Floods in Northern and Central England,"8 November, 2019","Update, 09  November 2019: One person died in the flooding after being swept away by the flooding River Derwent in Darley Dale, near Matlock in Derbyshire. Further evacuations were carried out in South Yorkshire after the River Don broke its banks flooding areas of Fishlake in Doncaster late on 08 November. Original report, 08 November 2019: Parts of northern and central England saw around a month’s worth of rain on 07 November, 2019. Rivers in South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire are extremely high and dozens of people have been evacuated. Heavy rain also triggered a landslide in Nottinghamshire where 35 homes were evacuated. As of 08 November there were 5 severe flood warnings for locations along the River Don in Yorkshire. The Environment Agency has also issued 116 flood warnings and 119 flood alerts, mostly in northern and central England. Roads have been closed in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire, including parts of the busy M1 motorway. Rail transport in South Yorkshire has also been disrupted. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said their control operators took nearly 1,200 emergency calls in 24 hours to 08 November, mostly from people trapped in cars or properties. Teams rescued more than 120 people, including many from a shopping centre and neighbouring retail outlets in Rotherham who were stranded by flood water. In Doncaster, levels of the River Don are at a record high. South Yorkshire Police issued warnings to residents in areas around Doncaster not to leave their homes unless necessary. On 08 November Doncaster Council said the river has broken its banks in Kirk Sandall and asked people to evacuate their homes. The previous day homes were flooded in the nearby village of Whiston after a small river, the Whiston Brook, broke its banks. Flooding blocked roads around the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield during the evening of 07 November, leaving shoppers stranded. South Yorkshire Police advised people to remain in the shopping centre until the flooding had cleared. Flooding from the River Dearne caused flooding in the Barnsley area, including Darton, Lundwood and Low Valley. Heavy rain caused a landslide in a residential area of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire on 07 November. Residents of 35 homes were evacuated. No injuries were reported. Rising levels of the River Ryton prompted evacuations in Worksop. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service said 25 homes were evacuated. Derbyshire Dales District Council has declared an emergency following floods in Matlock and Matlock Bath, where the Derwent river has flooded roads. The River Don has hit its highest recorded level in Doncaster. As of 08 November it stood at 6.36 metres, higher than the 6.3 of June 2007. The Don has also reached record levels at Kirk Bramwith, a village to the north of Doncaster, where it stood at 7.57 metres on 08 November. The Environment Agency said the Derwent river in Matlock, Derbyshire, was approaching record levels. As of 08 November it stood at 4.77 metres. The BBC reported that in a 24 hour period to 08 November, Sheffield recorded 84mm of rain. The average rainfall for the whole month of November in Sheffield is around 80mm. Further heavy rain and flooding is expected and likely to affect parts of Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire. https://twitter.com/SYPOperations/status/1192486434776727552 ⚠️DO NOT TRAVEL⚠️ Flooding has closed the lines between Sheffield and Gainsborough, Sheffield and Lincoln and Hebden Bridge and Manchester Victoria- and roads are also closed meaning customers should not attempt to travel. pic.twitter.com/m7pnyLionJ — Northern (@northernassist) November 7, 2019  ⚠️The River Don is breaching at St Oswald Church, Kirk Sandall.

UK – Days of Rain Cause Rivers to Overflow in England and Wales,"31 October, 2019","Emergency services have carried out over 100 flood rescues in England and Wales after days of heavy rain. Flooding has affected parts of Shropshire, Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire in England and Monmouthshire in Wales. The Environment Agency installed emergency flood barriers along several rivers including the Wye and Severn, protecting thousands of homes. The Wye river broke its banks causing some flooding in areas around Ross on Wye and Hereford, where around 20 homes were evacuated. Some flooding was also reported in areas around Worcester, where the Severn river was 4 metres above normal levels, and its highest since 2014. Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service said they rescued over 90 people from flooding-related incidents between 26 and 28 October, 2019. Areas along the border between England and Wales also saw some flooding after the Morrow river overflowed in parts on Monmouthshire, Wales, and near the village of Kentchurch in Herefordshire. In Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Services carried out flood rescues after the Churnett river broke its banks near Oakmoor. The town of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire has been surrounded by flood waters for 2 days after rivers overflowed. Tewkesbury stands at the confluence of the Avon and Severn rivers, which have broken their banks in the town for the fourth time in 12 years. There are a number of flood warnings in place in Gloucestershire following heavy rain at the weekend. The worst hit areas are around Tewkesbury and Lydbrook.

UK  – Met Office and the Environment Agency Mark 10 Years of Flood Forecasting,"11 October, 2019","Earlier this month the UK’s Met Office and the Environment Agency marked a 10-year partnership in flood forecasting which has saved lives, livelihoods, and protected infrastructure. The partnership has led to an evolution in the UK’s ability to forecast, mitigate against and respond to flood events. The Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) was set up in 2009 bringing together Met Office meteorologists and Environment Agency  hydrologists to provide crucial, timely warnings to emergency responders helping them make the critical decisions that save livelihoods and keep people safe. Floods Minister Rebecca Pow said: “It has been fascinating to see first-hand the incredible work taking place at the Flood Forecasting Centre as we celebrate its 10-year anniversary. This week alone, the FFC’s forecasts have helped colleagues at the Environment Agency to issue well over 200 flood alerts and warnings to help keep homes, businesses and communities safe. “I’m looking forward to seeing how the FFC develops an even deeper understanding of how we predict and prepare for weather events over the coming years. This work builds on the government’s £2.6 billion investment in new flood schemes to better protect 300,000 homes by 2021.” The FFC was set up in 2009, following recommendations made in the Pitt Review, to better understand how rainfall impacts river catchments and flash flooding. Over the 10 years since its inception it has helped reduce the impact of a number of extreme weather events, including: Wainfleet, June 2019 – parts of Lincolnshire saw around 2.5 times the monthly average rainfall between 10-12 June. The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for rain several days in advance enabling the Flood Forecasting Centre to provide timely, key information to the Environment Agency incident room in Lincoln which was then able to issue a severe flood warning to local residents. This led to the successful evacuation of around 600 homes – meaning nobody was harmed. Winter storms of 2013/14, From mid-December to early January, the UK experienced a spell of extreme weather as a succession of major winter storms brought widespread impacts to the UK. Initially most of the weather impacts related to the strong winds, however, as rainfall totals accumulated the focus of concern turned to flooding, including large river catchments such as the Severn and Thames. FFC guidance enabled emergency responders and local communities to make strategic decisions, such as moving huge water pumps onto the Somerset Levels, which mitigated impacts and protected lives and property. Met Office Chief Executive Professor Penny Endersby said; “Climate projections (UKCP18) suggest that whilst the UK may begin to experience drier summers overall, summer storms are likely to be more intense, and we are likely to see warmer but wetter winters in future, both of which will have a crucial bearing on the FFC’s operations. The risk and impacts of flooding are likely to increase over the coming years, so we will need to continue to adapt our services. As we look to the future it is clear that through collaboration and cooperation, together we can ensure that the UK can continue stay safe and thrive.” Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, said: “It’s great to be back in Exeter to celebrate 10 highly successful years of this essential life-saving multi-agency service. The FFC is part of the heroic unseen efforts that go on 24/7 to help protect people and properties against the risk of flooding. “Our flood defences reduce the risk of flooding, and our flood warnings help keep communities safe when it threatens. But we can never entirely eliminate the risk of flooding. Checking your flood risk on gov.uk is a crucial step towards protecting yourself, your loved ones and your home.” Forecasting skills are constantly evolving and developing thanks to world leading, cutting-edge science and technology and the collaboration between the Met Office and the Environment Agency. With higher maximum daily temperatures and more intense rainfall affecting the UK the impacts of flooding are likely to be greater in coming decades. The ability to accurately forecast flood events will therefore become ever more important.

UK – Floods Prompt Evacuations and Rescues,"1 October, 2019","The Environment Agency in England has issued over 250 warnings (75) or alerts for flooding (185) after days of heavy rain across the British Isles. Major floods are affecting parts of the Isle of Man where some residents are trapped in their homes. Flooding in Scotland has damaged roads and bridges, while flooding in Powys, Wales, has disrupted rail travel. A major incident has been declared on the Isle of Man with reports of people trapped in their homes due to flooding. Fire Rescue and Coastguard have been deployed to the area, with areas along the overflowing Laxey river said to be the worst affected. Several roads are closed on the island due to flooding and several vehicles have been washed away. The Environment Agency in England has also issued a Precautionary Evacuation Notice (PEN) flood warning for areas on on the Norfolk Coast in eastern England. The notice covers coastal communities of Hunstanton, Heacham and Snettisham. The Environment Agency said “The flood warnings have been issued because the combination of a high tide due at 8.40am tomorrow (Tuesday 1 October) and north-westerly winds up to force 6 could result in flooding.” In the west of England a search operation was called off by Gloucestershire Police after a man, feared to have been swept away by the Severn Bore wave, was found safe and well. In the Midlands, Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service said teams carried out high water rescues after a vehicle was aught in floodwater in Bretby, near Burton upon Trent. Flooding and heavy rain has disrupted train travel in parts of northern England and also in Powys, Wales. On the south coast of England strong winds and high waves on Sunday damaged property in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex. Heavy rain in Scotland on Saturday 28 caused flooding in parts of Aberdeenshire, damaging or destroying bridges and roads in several areas including King Edward and Crovie. Homes were left damaged and cars submerged after heavy rain caused flooding in Crovie, Aberdeenshire.

Climate Change to Increase Compound Flooding in Northern Europe,"20 September, 2019","Coastal areas of Northern Europe will experience an increase in “compound flooding” in coming decades as a result of climate change, say researchers. Compound flooding occurs where storm surges and heavy rainfall combine. Researchers say until recently this type of flooding in Europe was concentrated along Mediterranean countries. However, compound flooding will greatly increase for Northern European countries in the future as the climate warms, according to a study recently published in Science. This is the first study of compound flooding to consider future changes that could result from combined geographic shifts in precipitation, storm surges, waves and tides. The hazard of compound flooding is not usually included in coastal flooding risk analyses, even though storm surges and extreme precipitation runoff are related. What’s more, coastal cities are expected to further grow in the coming decades, underscoring an urgent need to assess future compound flooding probability. Assuming a warmer future climate, the researchers found the probability of compound flooding risk is likely to increase heavily along the west coast of Great Britain, northern France, the east and south coast of the North Sea, and the eastern half of the Black Sea. The Bristol Channel and the Devon and Cornwall coast in the UK, as well as the Dutch and German North Sea coast, are considered hot spots, with compound flooding events likely to occur more than once every six years. The threat is even worse near Noorderzijlvest in the Netherlands, where the compound flooding risk is expected to triple, and around Bergen on the Norwegian coast, where it may increase by fivefold.

Rising Risk: Flood Damage Now a Mental Health Threat in Britain,"5 September, 2019","A study shows that people whose homes are damaged by disasters are 50% more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, writes Laurie Goering for Thomson Reuters Foundation. LONDON, Sept 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – People in Britain whose homes are damaged by floods, storms or other wild weather are 50% more likely to suffer mental health problems such as depression or anxiety – even if they do not have to move out temporarily, researchers said on Thursday. That suggests disaster response may need to be better joined up with psychological support, as climate change brings larger and more frequent extreme weather threats, said Hilary Graham, a health sciences professor at the University of York. “There’s increasing awareness that beyond these very dramatic human impacts – like loss of life – there are what official reports refer to as ‘psychological casualties’,” said Graham, lead author of a new study. When extreme weather harms homes, “people’s mental health takes a big hit”, she added. Researchers looked at 7,500 people surveyed in a national assessment, the main source of information on mental health in England. They found that diagnosed mental health problems rose by about half in those whose homes were damaged by floods, storms, rain or wind. Some of that stress could be financial, they said, but a lost sense of security also seemed to be a significant issue. “We believe in the stability of our environment, that it will be the same place tomorrow as yesterday, and we derive a lot of security from that,” said Graham, a sociologist. “It’s not until that security is threatened that you realise how much you rely on it. Like Joni Mitchell said, ‘You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone’.” In particular, loss of priceless family photos and other memories “undermines people’s sense their home is a safe place”, Graham said. As Britain has largely avoided the deaths seen in other countries grappling with the growing risk of weather disasters, it has tended to focus on economic rather than health threats, researchers said. But as flood risk, in particular, grows – 1.4 million people are now signed up to receive Environment Agency flood warnings – health concerns will need more attention, said the study by the National Centre for Social Research and the University of York. The findings amount to “a wake-up call about the importance of thinking about mental health when we think about flood prevention”, Graham said. The Environment Agency and the National Health Service should cooperate more closely, she said, adding that “flood protection is health protection as well”. Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy and national adaptation at the Environment Agency, warned that the “devastating” impact of flooding on people “can last long after the flood waters have gone away”. And while efforts to boost flood defences will protect more homes, “we can never entirely eliminate the risk of flooding”, she said in a statement.

UK – Mass Evacuations As Dam Threatens to Break,"2 August, 2019","As many as 6,500 people have been evacuated from a town in Derbyshire, England, after the partial collapse of Toddbrook Reservoir dam. Heavy rain over the last few days also caused flooding in neighbouring parts of Cheshire and Greater Manchester, where emergency services rescued over 20 people from flooded properties. Heavy rain over the last few days caused the Toddbrook Reservoir dam to overflow, damaging the dam’s spillway in circumstances similar to the damaged spillway at Lake Oroville Dam in Northern California in February 2017. Local media report that virtually the whole town of Whaley Bridge was evacuated after the Environment Agency issued a “danger to life” warning. The agency said: “River levels in the River Goyt could still rise rapidly as a result of persistent rain and water coming from Toddbrook Reservoir on 01/08/2019. Evacuation plans are currently underway for the area of Whaley Bridge.” A military helicopter has been deployed to shore up flood defences and the dam wall. Around 150 firefighters were also on the scene using high-volume pumps to extract water. Areas of northern and central England have seen heavy rain over the last few days. Major flooding was reported in parts of Yorkshire on 30 July, damaging roads and bridges. The following day areas to the south of Manchester saw heavy rain. Firefighters rescued over 20 people from flooded properties in Poynton and Bramhall. Cheshire Fire and Rescue Services said that on 31 July, flash flooding caused major issues in the Poynton, Bollington and Wilmslow, affecting around 60 properties and resulting in a number of road closures. Between 60-90mm of rain fell in 24 hours. The rail line between Manchester Airport and Wilmslow, Cheshire, was blocked due to flooding as was the Manchester Airport link road.

UK – Flash Floods Cause Severe Damage in North of England,"31 July, 2019","A bridge was destroyed and roads washed away after torrential rain caused flash flooding in parts of northern England on 30 and 31 July, 2019. The worst of the damage was seen in the Yorkshire Dales National Park area. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said it received about 115 calls to flooding in Leyburn and Reeth during the evening of 30 July. A spokesman said: “We had several appliances, as well as our swift water rescue teams and high-volume pumping appliance within the area attending various incidents involving flooded properties and cars stuck in flood water.” A small bridge over a stream near Grinton was destroyed and a road near Richmond was washed away by the flooding. Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team said via Social Media: “Please note heavy flooding on all roads in the Swaledale area only travel if essential as many routes impassable. Although water levels are slowly easing some bridges are ‘out’ & lots of debris on the roads.” A landslip on 30 July blocked train tracks between Carlisle and Skipton, disrupting rail travel. The BBC reported that Malham Tarn in the Yorkshire Dales recorded 3.2 inches (82.2mm) of rain in 24 hours, the majority in the space of four hours. The monthly average in the area for this time of year is 3.5in (89mm). Heavy rain on 31 July flooded railway tracks between Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent, causing severe travel disruption. As of 31 July, the Environment Agency had 9 flood warnings and 33 flood alerts in place for areas of northern and central England. More rain is expected and the UK’s Met Office has issued a yellow warning for rain in the north of England and western parts of Scotland. The Met Office said: “Some parts of northern England could see as much as 40-60mm of rain through Wednesday, while thunderstorms could produce as much as 30-40mm in one to two hours.” A yellow severe weather warning for #rain has been updated: https://t.co/QwDLMfRBfs Stay #weatheraware @metofficeuk pic.twitter.com/abHCVaJYfn — Met Office (@metoffice) July 31, 2019  Literally stranded on road near Leyburn with both ends flooded and nowhere to go!! pic.twitter.com/IcJieqpnE5 — Mark Worrall (@ChesterBluey) July 30, 2019  Lots of reports of flash flooding around Leyburn and Reeth so please take care if you're driving in that area.

UK – Britain’s Coastal Towns and Villages Face a Design Challenge to Cope With Climate Emergency,"22 July, 2019","As an island nation, Britain has vulnerable communities that must be prepared for the impact of the climate emergency. And while much has been said about homes at risk from the sea in coastal regions, or those inland subject to river flooding, the UK Committee on Climate Change’s new progress report for 2019 has laid bare the challenge facing them. In 2018, Hemsby on the coast of Norfolk in the east of England saw several homes dramatically lost after storm surges caused metres of the sandy cliff edge to collapse. Over the last decade, major storms left substantial areas of England badly flooded for weeks or months, such as in 2007, 2009, 2012, and the winters of 2013-14 and 2015-16. The Environment Agency has said that the UK faces having to abandon areas rather than continue to defend them with the ever higher and stronger flood defences that would be necessary. According to the committee’s climate change risk assessment it is almost certain that England will have to adapt to at least one metre of sea level rise. Modelling studies have shown that flooding increases exponentially with rising sea levels. So for coastal areas subject to flooding it is not sufficient to increase the height of sea walls in line with sea level rise. The assessment predicts that up to 1.5m properties (including 1.2m residential homes) may be located in areas with an annual flood risk of once in 200 years or more by the 2080s. Around 8,900 properties are located in areas at risk from coastal erosion, this may increase to over 100,000 properties by the 2080s. While coastal erosion affects fewer properties than flooding, the impact is more drastic due to the inevitable and irrecoverable loss of land to the sea. Significant increases in coastal flood risk are projected to occur as early as the 2020s due to increases in storm frequency. According to the committee’s projections the number of residential properties exposed to flooding more frequently than once every 75 years (on average) is predicted to increase 20% by the 2020s under the scenario which gives a 4°C rise in global temperatures by the 2080s. However, the Committee on Climate Change’s latest report on dealing with these issues scores work on alleviating surface water flooding, and work on ensuring new building development is properly designed to manage flooding, both firmly in the “red” of the red-amber-green traffic light system indicating readiness. Other aspects of flood protection fare only slightly better, with river and coastal development flood protection and alleviation and flood recovery in general marked as “amber”. In the Netherlands, for centuries vulnerable to floods due to its low-lying land, a number of new approaches to water management have been adopted over the years in an effort to live with water rather than to fight it. Schemes range from flood-proof homes, including floating homes, to the Room for the River programme which entails strategies for planned evacuations, temporary relocation of farmers and villagers, and strategic flooding of polders (reclaimed areas separated by drainage dykes). The UK has its own approaches to manage increased flood risk, and is developing new approaches in view of the dire predictions by climate change experts under scenarios of both 2°C and 4°C global temperature rise. River flooding and coastal flooding (from waterway or coastal inundation), as well as surface water and groundwater flooding (from rain and storms and insufficient drainage), were categorised as the most significant sources of risk in the UK now and in the future. The committee’s projection of flood risk has identified the most cost-effective, engineering-based measures to reduce flooding as improving defences, managed realignment of the coast, catchment area management, and urban runoff management through sustainable drainage systems. In this case, “realignment” of the coast entails not only the natural changes to the physical coastline as a result of climate change, but also the decision to abandon or relocate entire settlements. This can have a significant personal and financial impact on those residents affected. While the abandonment of properties in places like Happisburgh and Hemsby in Norfolk due to coastal erosion is well known, we can see from the map above that many other coastal areas around the Humber, Mersey, Severn and Thames estuaries are at risk. Those affected, and also key infrastructure assets, will need to be evaluated to ascertain whether they should be included in this process of coastal realignment. The area around the Thames in southern England is likely to be classed as worth protecting due to the high numbers of people living there, for example. In addition, a number of low-lying inland plains will also be lost – many of which were selected for housing development only a few decades ago. While planning and building regulations can reduce flood risk to new-build properties within affected areas, anticipated population growth means that there is increasing pressure to build on floodplains. According to Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency, the number of properties built on floodplains will double over the next 50 years, creating further flood risk problems. The UK has a significant number of key industries and infrastructure at the coast – for example power stations, petrochemical plants, steel industries and oil and gas infrastructure. To tackle the associated design challenges for housing, business and industries appropriate funding and having a well-skilled engineering force will be key. In view of the increasing impact of climate change we need to urgently build our resilience to flooding. Flood resilience includes knowing what the risks are and where. We need flexible engineering solutions, including natural flood risk management, as well as ways to help society adapt. We need to make sure we have the right people with the right skills at all levels to address related socio-economic issues, including hard decisions on what to fight to keep, and what can be lost.

UK – Ipswich Tidal Flood Barrier Wins Top Engineering Award,"9 July, 2019","The  Ipswich Tidal Flood Barrier in England, UK, has won an Exceptional Merit Award from the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) East of England Merit Awards. The project, which better protects over 1,600 homes and 400 businesses from the risk of flooding, was recognised in the Technical Excellence and Innovation category. ICE is a professional membership body, supporting more than 90,000 engineers around the world. Costing almost £70million, the Ipswich Flood Defence Management Strategy comprises a mix of new and refurbished flood walls and gates along 1,100 metres of the River Orwell. The barrier’s centrepiece is a 200-tonne rotating Radial Sector Gate, which can be raised in minutes in the event of a tidal surge. The barrier was officially unveiled by Floods Minister Dr Thérese Coffey in February. The flood gate has a design similar to that of the Thames Barrier and is so large that it is coated with 6 tonnes of protective paint. The flood gate rotates upwards out of the sea floor into the closed position, holding back dangerous tidal surges that could flood the town. The new defences provide a much higher level of protection from the type of tidal surge which threatened the town in 2007 and 2013, both of which were close to spilling over the existing defences. Aside from the reduced flood risk benefits, the flood defence scheme has the added advantage of helping to boost the local economy through freeing up hectares of land for regeneration. The Environment Agency project was approved by Defra in 2006 and has been delivered by contractor VBA – a joint venture between VolkerStevin, Boskalis Westminster and Atkins. The barrier scheme has an exemplary health and safety record. Risk on the project was designed using 3D and physical modelling, along with VolkerStevin’s behavioural safety programme. This resulted in no reportable incidents throughout the three year construction process, which comprised more than 300,000 hours of work. As a result, the project is now being used as a case study for other Environment Agency works including the Boston Barrier. Andrew Usborne, the lead officer on the scheme, said the award was welcome recognition for the Environment Agency and its partners. He said, “This is fantastic news for everyone involved, including all the Environment Agency staff, our contractors VBA and sub-contractors. “It has been a hugely successful construction project, one which is being used as an example to other Environment Agency schemes across the country of safe and effective partnership working.” This is not the only recognition the project has received – it has picked up the Civils Project of the Year at the Constructing Excellence SECBE Awards 2019, presented by the South East Centre for the Built Environment. The scheme has also been shortlisted by the British Construction Industry Awards in the Climate Resilience Project of the Year category.

Why People in a Flooded British Town Were Told to Stop Flushing the Toilet,"29 June, 2019","The British town of Wainfleet in Lincolnshire is underwater. After two months rain in two days, the River Steeping burst its banks, and 580 homes were evacuated. Curiously, the advice to the town’s remaining residents is to avoid flushing the toilet or using the washing machine whenever possible – advice that is more usually associated with drought rather than flood. The request suggests that Wainfleet’s sewer system is dangerously close to capacity. Using the loo and washing machine not only puts a demand on the water supply system, but it also adds to the flows in the local sewer, which is likely to be very full. Like most towns in Europe, Wainfleet’s town centre was constructed before the 1950s, and will be served by a “combined sewer” that takes both the waste water from toilets and showers, and the rainwater from roofs and roads. This resulting dilute waste water then needs to be treated before it is discharged into the environment. If the volume of water is too much for the treatment plant to handle then a “combined sewage overflow” will release dilute sewage into rivers and oceans. It is because of combined sewage overflows that it’s not a good idea to bathe in rivers or beaches after there has been rainfall. An additional problem in Wainfleet (and many low-lying areas like London, much of the Netherlands or New Orleans in the US) is that the sewer system is lower than the level of the river or sea. This means that the wastewater/rainwater combination does not just need treatment, but it also needs pumping. If there is too much water for the treatment works or pumps to process at any one moment, then water from streets or homes will be unable to enter the sewer system, and dirty water, including dilute sewage, can overflow into rivers, streets and homes. A dramatic example of this happened in Hull in 2007. Just like in Wainfleet, heavy summer rainstorms put pressure on treatment systems and pumps. More than 8,000 homes were flooded, and some people were out of their homes for over a year. Such flooding causes huge physical disruption and challenges people’s mental health. Imagine unexpectedly losing most of your possessions, simultaneously needing to find a new place to live for an unpredictable length of time, having to manage the family routines from a different location, and meanwhile having to negotiate with insurers and builders about the renewal of your home. As climate change threatens to bring more sudden rainstorms, many places are becoming more vulnerable to problems like those in Wainfleet and Hull. One way to address these problems is to slow down the flow of rainwater. The hard surfaces of roads, pavements and pipes, for example, speed up the flow of water. Some agricultural drainage practices may also encourage water to flow rather than waterlog the land. What this all means is that all the water from the rainstorm arrives at the treatment and pumping facilities at the same time. We can address these problems – in Wainfleet as elsewhere – but it will take many small changes to the way people manage their water. All over the world, local authorities are exploring how they can repurpose parks and other open spaces to help to store the water from heavy rainfall. In Firs Farm Park in the London borough of Enfield, for example, playing fields have been raised and others transformed into wetland to hold back the water and prevent flooding downstream. This work has helped to stimulate the involvement of local people in maintaining the park, while the wetlands provide a nature resource for schoolchildren. Similar projects are being explore as far apart as Bergen, Norway, and Belo Horizonte, Brazil. On a smaller scale, water can be held back in street rain gardens. These small patches of planting combined with dropped kerbs offer opportunities for infiltrating water and greening the streets. Residents may have to sacrifice some local parking spaces, but such investments can make a neighbourhood more pleasant for everyone, as well as reducing the flows downstream. The request to minimise household inputs to the sewer system is one small immediate way to mobilise local residents to help address the threat of flooding. But residents with a garden can help in other ways too. Most UK houses have gutters that discharge directly to the sewer. Depending on the local geology, garden soakaways (stone-filled ditches which can soak up water if it rains), retain the water so it drains more slowly to the ground or the sewer. Another way to accomplish this task is with a raintank. Most people think of raintanks (or water butts) as a way to protect against droughts. But as long as a tank has some space in it, it also has the potential to provide added protection for a neighbourhood from flooding. My research team is currently exploring whether we can make “leaky raintanks”. The idea here is that as well as storing water for use in the garden, the tank will also have a space which is able to fill up in a storm and then drain slowly into the sewer. If every household in a neighbourhood had a “leaky raintank”, it could make a significant difference to the amount of water storage during a storm. Whether helping to replan the local park, participating in discussing which parts of the street can form a rain garden, or through managing a soakaway or raintank on your private land, water management is increasingly seen as something which is too big and too important to leave just to technical experts. We are all part of the water system, and those that manage water are recognising that people are able and willing to undertake actions to improve the water system. Meanwhile, technical experts more widely need to recognise that water is part of lived in and natural landscapes – and this must be reflected in sewers and streets. In a time in which water-related threats are worsening, society needs to look beyond isolated problems of floods or droughts, and to consider how wise water management can deliver local benefits as well as a more resilient landscape for everyone.

UK – Rescues After Heavy Rain Causes Floods in Scotland,"25 June, 2019","Hours of heavy rain on 24 June caused flash flooding in Scotland’s capital Edinburgh and other eastern and central parts of the country. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said on 24 June via Social Media, “Intense rainfall continues to move north across central belt and eastern Scotland, resulting in surface water disruption on urban roads and transport links.” The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said firefighters worked throughout East and Central Scotland with partners to protect communities and property as torrential rain caused widespread localised flooding. In Edinburgh, flooded streets caused problems for the city’s drivers and public transport. Tram services were temporarily suspended in some areas after flood water had covered tracks. According to the UK’s Met Office, Edinburgh saw 44.4mm of rain in 24 hours to 24 June. In Stirling, central Scotland, heavy rain caused damage to several buildings including a supermarket. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service reported that they rescued 14 people stranded in a flooded building during the evening of 24 June.

UK – Inland Flood Defences Save £1.1 Billion a Year,"18 June, 2019","£1.1 billion a year of flood damage is being prevented by the UK’s current network of river barriers and defences, according to landmark research published by the UK insurance industry. This is the first time the financial contribution of river water defences has been quantified in this way. The modelling, based on thousands of simulations of weather events with and without flood defences, was commissioned by Flood Re and conducted by Risk Management Solutions (RMS). It emphasises the value to UK homes and businesses of flood defence spending and the importance of on-going investment by governments, particularly for flood-prone locations such as Cumbria, Yorkshire, Somerset  and the Welsh Valleys. It shows that inland flooding would, on average, cost almost 3 times more on an annual basis without the defences – a bill of £1.8 billion rather than £0.7 billion across the whole of the UK. In England, the Government currently spends around £0.6 billion each year on building and maintaining flood defences, with the Environment Agency recently recommending an annual spend of £1 billion on all flood risk management. Some areas of the UK have seen more than 2 months’ of rain fall in a few days, causing flooding in Lincolnshire, Kent and areas around London. This a timely reminder that any long-term government spending allocations need to reflect the importance of on-going funding for flood management. Closer examination of what happened in Cumbria in December 2015 shows the flooding caused by Storm Desmond would have done damage worth three-and-a-half times as much without river water defences – £2.8 billion rather than £0.6 billion. James Dalton, Director of General Insurance Policy at the ABI, said that, “faced with the growing threat of climate change, there is a clear financial argument for investing in flood defences. The barriers, walls and natural defences that currently prevent greater damage being done by the UK’s rivers during times of extreme weather make economic sense, but they must keep pace with the threat if they are to continue being effective. It’s essential the UK Government sticks to its ambitions on flood defence spending and doesn’t let the lack of severe flooding in recent years lull the country into a false sense of security.” EnglandNorthern IrelandScotlandWales",https://floodlist.com/protection/uk-inland-flood-defences-savings,0,,,Desmond,"England, Somerset, Lincolnshire, UK, Cumbria, London",False,False,False,OtherFlood (no numerics)
Britain Is in the Middle of a Drought – So How Come There’s Flooding?,"13 June, 2019","Parts of the UK had more than a month’s rain in one day on Monday June 10. More rain on the following Tuesday, particularly in the north of England and Midlands, created localised flooding. Sinkholes appearing on the M25 – one of Europe’s busiest motorways – and closed train lines have created expensive travel chaos. The flooding of hospitals and other essential services has even put lives at risk. In the middle of all this, groundwater levels across the country are much lower than normal. There’s been little rain between 2018 and 2019 – the winter was drier than normal and it wasn’t so long ago that Britain was basking in one of the warmest Easter weekends on record. Still yellowing lawns suggest that hardly any rain has fallen since. This isn’t an usual pattern of weather and it isn’t specifically linked to climate change. Slow-moving, intense bands of rainfall can emerge in the summer, though wetter Junes can possibly be linked to climate change as the jet stream – which is responsible for steering much of the weather systems we get over Britain – changes due to a warming atmosphere. You might expect the dry ground to soak up all the water, but it hasn’t for several reasons. The rainfall has been so intense that the ground can’t soak it up fast enough. So many of the surfaces in urban areas of the UK are paved over and don’t allow water to soak through naturally, causing huge amounts of run-off. Smaller rivers respond very quickly to heavy rainfall, which is why we have seen many smaller rivers and tributaries bursting their banks and causing localised flooding. Many of the flood warnings in place in the north of England and Midlands are for tributaries and smaller rivers with names that many people have never heard of before, but these often flow through urban areas and close to homes and businesses. Whatever the river is called, it’s not much fun when it’s flowing through your kitchen. The bigger rivers on the other hand, such as the Thames and Severn take much longer to respond to heavy rain and will only flood when water tables are much higher than they are at present. Lower groundwater levels mean that larger rivers are able to swallow up extra water without too much trouble. If rain keeps up for another month or two, we could be in trouble. This is what happened during the winter of 2013-14, when months of rain meant the Thames flooded towns like Oxford, Staines and Wraysbury, and low-lying parts of Somerset resembled a lake. What does this mean? It’s a reminder that floods are pretty simple – lots of rain very often equals flooding, no matter what has happened with the weather in previous weeks and months. It also shows that floods are made worse by the way people have changed the landscape – paving over areas so that water runs off the ground too quickly, creating floods that are essentially human-made. Floods are only a problem when people are in the way of them. Britain needs to build more homes, but where and how many will affect the risk of more floods in future. There are still plans to build homes on floodplains, which we should avoid. The construction of sustainable drainage systems – ditches and ponds that hold back water where it falls and prevent heavy rain from rushing into rivers too quickly – hasn’t gone far enough. Dealing with flooding is a team effort – it requires collaboration between flood authorities, landowners, homeowners, community groups, and local and national government. Only by working together can effective action be taken. People very often have good local knowledge about flooding. They know when and where it will flood, and can sometimes be perplexed when “experts” tell them otherwise. Much of the political fallout during the 2013-14 flooding was not due to the damage itself, but anger from communities who felt abandoned or ignored. As the UK commits to limit future climate change by setting emissions targets, people must consider the costs of the climate change people are already experiencing. This means changing how we live our lives, not just to prevent future floods but to deal with floods when they next occur. We must prepare better for floods, not just for the next decade, but for those next week.

"UK – Floods Will Cost the UK Billions, but AI Can Help Make Sewers the First Defence","14 May, 2019","The UK will need to spend £1 billion a year on flood management to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to the national Environment Agency. The organisation’s chair, Emma Boyd, said “we can’t win a war against water by building away climate change with infinitely high flood defences”, and warned that entire communities may need to change location due to flood risk. More frequent extreme weather events – particularly flooding – are a hallmark of climate change. By their very nature, such events are unpredictable and can do substantial damage to communities. Significant floods occur in the UK every few years, so the way flooding is managed can have a major impact on how much damage is done, while poor strategic decisions such as building on historic flood plains can leave new communities vulnerable. Coastal defences – including sea walls, buffer areas and evacuation plans – can help to protect towns and cities against flooding from storm surges. But inland flooding caused by excess rainwater requires more nuanced solutions. Humans have altered water courses such as rivers, streams and canals for centuries, and every change affects the way the ground responds to flooding. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) can use data to help make decisions about how water should flow in and around human settlements, to avoid the worst effects of flooding. In cities, every drain is an opportunity to adjust the movement of water. At the University of Sheffield we worked with partners to create the CENTAUR system (Cost Effective Neural Technique to Alleviate Urban flood Risk), which uses AI to manage the flow of water in cities. The system works by installing “gates” in the sewer network that can control the flow of water from one part of the sewer network to another. Sensors are also added, to monitor water levels on either side of the gates. The gates can be controlled remotely during extreme weather events, to prevent flooding in important areas. For example, if a part of the network starts flooding downstream, the system can detect rising water levels and close a gate upstream, to slow the flow of water or divert it into other parts of the sewer with spare capacity, and thereby prevent water from overflowing onto the street. The “smart” bit, implemented by researchers at the university, was to create computer software that is capable of managing these systems independently of humans, and learning from its mistakes. The control system makes use of fuzzy logic – a way of interpreting uncertain conditions, such as the actual water level – and making decisions in those situations. The CENTAUR system has proven successful in pilot installations in Coimbra, Portugal (2017) and Toulouse, France (2018). It has a relatively low cost, in the tens of thousands of euros, which means it can be easily incorporated into existing flood defence programmes. There are limitations though: if there is no spare capacity for water in a city’s sewers, then managing them with AI in this way would have very few benefits. The major issue when defending against floods is that water has to go somewhere. In small floods, water might be able to be diverted so that no area gets flooded. But during larger floods, the priority is not preventing flooding altogether, but managing which areas flood, and limiting the danger to people, property and key infrastructure. Often, flood defence strategies divert flood water from urban areas into rural farmland and areas where fewer people live. To do this, water is either held upstream from urban areas by partially blocking rivers, or encouraged to move downstream more quickly by dredging or expanding rivers. While innovative flood management systems such as CENTAUR can help to protect people living in urban areas from flooding, the water has to be diverted. Decisions about which communities are offered greater protection from flooding, and which are left with limited defences, have the potential to set communities against one another. That’s why these higher level decisions cannot be left to AI. Many different groups need to be involved in such decisions. Farmers might be in control of some drainage channels, water companies are generally responsible for the sewerage network and environment agencies are responsible for river systems. Of course, the communities that are affected are also entitled to a say on it all. Local, regional and national governments must listen to and negotiate with all of these groups, to create a sound strategy for flood prevention. These discussions have major implications, not just for the UK, but for the way nations deal with climate change around the world. The costs of stopping climate change will be very high for some countries – especially those which depend on coal for economic development (such as China). Yet for others – such as the Maldives, which is threatened by flooding from storms and rising sea levels – the cost of inaction will be far greater. Smart technology can help to mitigate the consequences of climate change, but it will take global action by world leaders to prevent it from reaching crisis point.

UK Urged to Spend £1 Billion a Year on Flood Defences as World Warms,"10 May, 2019","LONDON, May 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – England must prepare for global warming of up to 4 degrees Celsius (7.2°F) that threatens to put millions of households at risk of devastating flooding, a public body warned on Thursday. Officials must spend £1 billion ($1.30 billion) per year to strengthen England’s flood and coast defences to protect communities, the Environment Agency (EA) said as it launched a long-term strategy to tackle the issues. “The coastline has never stayed in the same place and there have always been floods, but climate change is increasing and accelerating these threats,” said EA chairwoman Emma Howard Boyd in a statement. “We need to develop consistent standards for flood and coastal resilience in England that help communities better understand their risk and give them more control about how to adapt and respond.” England is at high risk from flooding as sea levels rise and climate change drives more extreme weather. Global leaders have pledged to attempt to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial temperatures but the head of the last year warned not enough action was being taken and the world is currently on track to warm between 3 and 5C. London used to flood during storm surges until the Thames Barrier came into use in 1982, protecting the city. Now some British towns are following the capital’s lead in building flood barriers. More than 5 million people in England are already at risk from flooding and coastal erosion, the EA said, and the number of properties built on flood plains is likely to double over the next 50 years due to population growth and climate change. England’s infrastructure must be fully resilient to flooding and coastal change by 2050, the EA said. All new development must be built to withstand flooding, it said, and some communities in high-risk areas should be gradually moved out in the longer term. Other measures that should be considered include temporary barriers and sustainable drainage systems along with effective flood warnings and smart design to allow properties to quickly recover from floods, the agency said. It also called for work to increase awareness of the issue, saying only two thirds of people living in areas at risk of flooding are aware of the dangers. “Everyone can see climate change accelerating,” said John Gummer, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, Britain’s independent climate adviser. Britain “urgently needs to stay ahead of worsening impacts by adapting”, but must also look to reduce emissions to zero to help prevent worst-case global warming scenarios, he said in a statement.

UK – Flood Rescues After Rivers Overflow in England and Wales,"18 March, 2019","Heavy rain brought flooding to parts of England and Wales from 16 March, 2019, damaging roads and homes and prompting several flood rescues. The BBC reports that homes in Conwy county in Wales were flooded, including Betws-y-Coed and Llanrwst, where three people had to be rescued from a vehicles stuck in flood water. Roads have been closed in various parts of the country. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said about 40 properties had flooded in Parc yr Eryr, Llanrwst. Capel Curig in Wales recorded 136.6 mm of rain in 24 hours to 17 March. At one point on 16 March there were 9 flood warnings and 18 flood alerts in place across Wales. The Conwy River at Pont Fawr reached it’s highest levels in recent times, standing at 8.25 metres late on 16 March, an increase of over 3 metres in around 2 days. Parts of northern England also saw some heavy rain from 16 to 17 March, 2019. The Environment Agency said it had reports of “localised flooding” in the Calder Valley, Greater Manchester, York and the areas around the River Severn in the Midlands. Flooding disrupted rail transport and blocked several roads were closed. Lancashire Fire Service said they were called on to rescue people from vehicles trapped in flood water. Firefighters also rescued a flock of 170 sheep from rising flood water after the River Ribble burst its banks in Samlesbury near Preston in Lancashire. As of 18 March there remained 20 flood warnings and 30 flood alerts in place, with as many as 70 flood warnings and flood alerts removed in the last 24 hours. The Environment Agency has installed temporary flood barriers along the River Sever in the Midlands area. Dave Throup, Environment Agency manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, said via Social Media, “The Severn is a slow river. It takes 4 to 5 days for rainfall to work its way through the system. As a result levels will be high and flood risk raised for a couple more days from Saturday’s rain.” Upstream gauging stations showing record levels on Conwy but our monitoring point in #Llanrwst haven't yet reached that mark…we are monitoring levels closely and will  issue further warnings if needed. pic.twitter.com/LRzPB5O9uv — Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru | Natural Resources Wales (@NatResWales) March 16, 2019  This is Bangor on Dee Wrexham.

Total Flood Defence Is a Myth: We Must Learn to Live With the Water,"5 March, 2019","Floods happen. Rivers have always inundated their floodplains and the sea has always tried to reclaim land that has been taken from it. This is certainly true in Somerset, whose name derives from the Old English word for “land of the summer people”; so called because it was too wet in winter. In 1607 a major storm caused floods that killed about 2,000 people and swept away whole villages in Somerset and down the Bristol Channel. This was probably the greatest ever loss of life from British weather. In the great flood of 1872, more than 100 square miles of land were flooded between October and the following March, and again in 1919. So while this month’s rainfall figures record that parts of England have had the wettest January on record, in the south-west it is only the fifth wettest. However, the previous winter of 2012-2103 also saw parts of the Somerset Levels similarly underwater for more than 100 days. So the floodwaters are not unprecedented – and this raises two questions: could the damage have been reduced and can we expect more frequent flooding in the future? Undoubtedly damage can be reduced, but at a cost – politically and financially. For example, the standards of coastal and river flood defences in the Netherlands are much higher,and much more costly. With much of the population living below sea level, the reasons for this willingness to spend so much to avoid catastrophic damages is readily apparent. When flood defences failed during the great storm of 1953 it led to 350 deaths in Britain, and 1,800 in the Netherlands. During the storms in December 2013, the highest storm surge since 1953, there were 26 breaches of the sea defences in East Anglia. But forward warning saw timely evacuations, properties protected and the Thames Barrier raised to counter the highest water level since it was built. Because there had been the will to protect and money to do so, nobody died. How much are we prepared to spend now, especially if as climate models suggest flooding will increase in the future? Flood protection in London is much higher, justified by the huge cost were central London to be flooded. But protection is not total, and defences could be overcome by a sufficiently strong flood, albeit rare. While this indicates how flooding can be devastating even without causing deaths, the investment in flood defences must be warranted, particularly if losses can be met by insurance. The balance that must be made depends on our estimates of risk, probability and damages, and each is uncertain since we have barely 100 years of data on which to base our estimates, and often much less. Models of the impacts of future change cannot yet provide robust estimates of how flood frequencies might be changing. In a sense it does not matter, because floods happen anyway. There were major floods on the Thames and Severn in 1924, 1947 and 1960, and in 2000, 2007 and 2013. The decision that needs to be made is how far people living in flood-risk areas should expect to be protected. Low-lying areas at risk were avoided as sites for permanent habitation in the past. Flood plains were left as water meadows, and crops were planted in spring time to avoid winter flooding. With nothing to be damaged, the impact was minor. In 1954, the UK’s record highest annual rainfall was recorded at Sprinkling Tarn in the Lake District. The total that year was over 6,500 mm, the equivalent of 21 Cockermouth floods falling in a single year. Yet a trawl through the Cumberland and Westmoreland Gazette for 1954 reveals discussion of the fact that it did not stop raining, but little in the way of reports of damages – because there was little on the flood plains to be damaged. Flood defences change that approach, bringing an unwarranted air of invincibility. Defences lower the risk of damage from moderate flooding, but this year, or the next, or within 10 years, at some point a flood that exceeds their capacity will arrive. The aim should be to reduce the impact of a flood when it does happen by limiting the amount of people and property at risk behind the defences. Instead, building defences tends to encourage development behind the embankments or walls. In this way, even if overtopping floods occur rarely, the damages from those that do occur rapidly increase, even with major investment in flood defences. Where’s the sense in spending more on defences if the damages will increase in the long term anyway? The most fundamental question is why society as a whole should pay to protect the one in six households in flood risk areas, many built in the last decade, and some such as at Kendal in Cumbria and Ruthin in Wales flooded within months of their occupants moving in. Under the government’s new flood insurance plans, from 2015 all household insurance policy holders will pay a levy to do so, alongside hundreds of millions of pounds allocated every year to flood management from taxation. Since the floods in 2000 there has in fact been a policy shift towards mitigating damage rather than trying to build hard defences aimed at protection. Strategies that provide storage for flood waters in areas where damage will be minimised, land management to reduce runoff, restoration of natural river channels, and sustainable urban drainage schemes are being implemented as ways of coping with the impact of a risk that cannot be entirely eliminated. These are more “natural” ways of dealing with excess water, but may leave some properties and land less well protected or dependent on costly flood proofing. Perhaps if people who wish to live in flood risk areas were required to install flood proofing measures before moving in, it might focus attention to the areas’ vulnerability. The emabattled Environment Agency has been accused of neglecting drainage and defences in the Somerset Levels for years, and it does seem that this rural area has not been a priority for expenditure – something exacerbated by the current budget cuts. Without a sudden change in priorities, this government will have cut channel maintenance spending by 45% by 2015. Groups such as the Floods on the Levels Action Group and National Farmers Union have suggested that such cuts represent a false economy when the costs of emergency pumping, disruption to the local population, and need to produce food are taken into account. Results of studies commissioned by the Environment Agency after the 2012 winter floods, presented in an open letter by the Somerset Drainage Board, suggest that dredging would have significantly reduced the period of flooding in parts of the levels from months to days (although having seen only results I cannot comment on the assumptions made). But dredging is not always the right solution, and in some places might increase the risk to bridges or to areas downstream, and can allow the tides to move faster and reach further upstream, backing up flood waters in the rivers. This was one reason why London’s flood defences have had to be raised in the 20th century following dredging in the Thames estuary. Nevertheless, the government has promised the Somerset rivers will be dredged as soon as possible. Just as the flood defences in Carlisle were redesigned after the floods in 2005, this must be considered a political decision in response to the misery of those affected – and the resulting media coverage. After all, when flood defences succeed it’s not nearly so newsworthy as when they fail. But more spending on protection still poses the question as to whether this will lead to more flood plain development and more potential damage in the future. It does not appear as if we are managing the potential for future flooding that well, particularly in communicating to people in flood risk areas that they cannot be completely protected and that – even with flood defences in place – they should expect floodwaters, and prepare for them.

UK – Ipswich Tidal Flood Barrier Officially Opened,"12 February, 2019","The Environment Agency’s new tidal flood defence barrier for Ipswich has been officially opened by Floods Minister, Dr Thérèse Coffey, ensuring more than 1,600 homes and 400 businesses are better protected from flooding and the impacts of climate change over the course of the next century. Costing almost £70 million, the new flood defences centrepiece is a 200-tonne rotating barrier which can be raised in minutes, helping to keep the town safe from tidal surges during storms. The flood defence scheme, which will reduce the risk of flooding to 1,608 homes and 422 businesses as well as key infrastructure, has been partnership funded by the Environment Agency (£54.6 million), Ipswich Borough Council through the Haven Gateway Partnership (£3.4 million) and the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership (£6.6 million), the Regional Flood and Coastal Committee (£1.7 million) and UK Power Networks (£1.1 million). The flood gate has a design similar to that of the Thames Barrier and is so large that it is coated with 6 tonnes of protective paint. The flood gate rotates upwards out of the sea floor into the closed position, holding back dangerous tidal surges that could flood the town. The defence also includes 1,100 metres of new and refurbished flood walls and a series of flood gates on the banks of the River Orwell. Now finished, the scheme will better protect homes and businesses in Ipswich over the next 100 years from the increased flood risks associated with climate change. The new defences will provide a much higher level of protection from the type of tidal surge which threatened the town in 2007 and 2013, both of which were close to spilling over the existing defences. The government’s most recent climate change projections predict that sea levels could rise by up to 1.15 metres, increasing the risk of tidal surges affecting those living on the coast. This project will see Ipswich better protected not only for today’s flood risk but also for that faced by generations to come. Aside from the reduced flood risk benefits, Ipswich’s new flood defence scheme has the added advantage of helping to boost the local economy through freeing up hectares of land for regeneration. Today, Dr Thérèse Coffey MP, Floods Minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and neighbouring MP for Suffolk Coastal, cut the ribbon to mark the official opening of the barrier at the eye-catching new control building on the waterfront. Floods Minister Thérèse Coffey said, “This important new flood scheme, which has received nearly £55 million of government funding, over 80% of the total cost, will better protect over 1,600 homes in Ipswich from tidal flooding over the next 100 years. “The scheme will also secure the future of hundreds of local businesses whilst creating 4,000 jobs to boost the town’s economy.

"Caring for the Hills Protects Us From Flooding, Says New Research","22 January, 2019","A restoration scheme on the hills of the Peak District has the potential to reduce the level of flood risk to the towns and villages below, according to researchers. Professors Tim Allott and Martin Evans and Dr Emma Shuttleworth, from The University of Manchester, say measures taken by conservation group Moors for the Future Partnership reduced peak flows of water from moorland areas. Moors for the Future Partnership has restored over 32 square kilometres of bare peat since its formation in 2003 through a range of interventions, including stabilising bare peat, and blocking erosion gullies with dams. The measures were put in place to tackle the destructive impact of climate change, pollution, wildfires and unsympathetic management of the land. But experts also think that sustainable management in the Peak District has the potential to alleviate flood risk downstream in at-risk communities such as Glossop, which was badly affected in 2002. The study details the findings of the Making Space for Water project, a collaboration between the Manchester researchers and Moors for the Future Partnership. It is published in Journal of Hydrology X, and was funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Using test areas on Kinder Scout, the team that found that re-vegetation of bare peat and damming up gullies reduces the peak volume of flow by 57%, and triples the time between peak rain and peak flow. The increase in roughness provided by the vegetation and gully blocks slows the flow of water across the landscape. This lessens the impact of storm events by slowing the delivery of water from hillslopes to rivers below, and if implemented widely can help reduce flood risk downstream – Dr Emma Shuttleworth ​Though this restoration work has been pioneered by Moors for the Future Partnership for over 15 years, the focus has largely been on erosion control and improving biodiversity. The new research shows that flood control can now be added to the many benefits of restoring damaged peatlands. This is an example of natural flood management, which seeks to restore natural river processes that have been adversely affected by human actions. “Restoration work is happening across many upland areas of the UK, and so our findings suggest that other regions may be benefiting from as yet unaccounted for flood control improvements,” said Professor Allott. “This work is continuing through our new NERC-funded project, Protect-NFM, which builds on the findings of the paper, and will explore ways to optimise landscape restoration as a low-cost way to reduce the risk from flash flooding in rural communities near steep upland streams and rivers,” added Professor Evans. “This work presented here is an important step in evidencing how blanket bog conservation reduces flood risk,” said Dr Dave Chandler, Science Programme Manager at Moors for the Future Partnership. “It clearly demonstrates the huge magnitude of this effect in the uplands, confirming our theory that one of the many benefits of repairing damaged blanket bog is a reduction in flow rates from the uplands. It is also an important step in evidencing the key ecosystem services provided by healthy blanket bogs, and the impact of our conservation work for the communities in the valleys below.” “Peatlands are a fantastic resource and restoration projects have multiple benefits to the environment,” said Christian Wilcox, Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager for the Environment Agency. “We are pleased to be involved in this study by supporting the team with hydrometric data and advice. We are curious and interested to see what the findings will show in terms of evidence for flood risk reduction and look forward to seeing another example of how natural flood risk management can leave a real legacy of multiple benefits for future generations. Projects such as this that have the potential to deliver habitat, flood risk, and wider health and well-being benefits are always exciting to be a part of.” Source: University of Manchester England",https://floodlist.com/protection/caring-for-the-hills-protects-us-from-flooding-says-new-research,1,,,,UK,False,False,False,FlashFlood (no numerics)
UK – Hull’s £42m Tidal Flood Scheme Gets the Green Light,"20 January, 2019","Construction of a multi-million pound scheme to protect thousands of homes and businesses in Hull from flooding from the Humber has been given the go ahead. In the past 65 years, there have been three major tidal events in Hull, the last was in December 2013 when 264 properties were flooded due to the overtopping of the existing defences. During high tides, water levels have the potential to rise to around 1 – 3m above some parts of the city. The new £42 million flood alleviation scheme, approved by Hull’s planning committee earlier this month on the fifth anniversary of the tidal surge that caused devastation to the city, has now had final sign off from the Secretary of State for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Led by the Environment Agency, the Humber Hull Frontage Improvement Scheme will upgrade tidal flood defences at eight locations along the estuary foreshore, including at St Andrew’s Quay and Victoria Dock Village. Floods Minister Thérèse Coffey said “I am delighted that the owners of 113,000 homes and businesses in and around Hull will benefit from a fully government funded flood defence improvements which will help for many decades to come. “This new flood defence scheme costing £42 million from taxpayers’ money has been well supported by the City Council and a number of other key partners, showing what can be achieved when we work together towards a common goal.” The defences will provide a 1 in 200 year standard of protection and will reduce tidal risk for 113,000 homes and businesses. It will see more than 7 kilometres of tidal flood defences along the Humber estuary improved. The design of the flood defences will include some areas of glass panels to maintain a view of the waterfront and recessed sections to display artistic works. Opportunities for public art and community involvement will also be integrated into the scheme, at areas including Victoria Dock Village and St Andrew’s Quay Retail park. Helen Tattersdale, Project Manager at the Environment Agency said: “We are delighted that the Humber Hull Frontages scheme has been given final approval and look forward to making progress on the ground early in the New Year. “This £42 million investment is great news for the city as it will allow us to better protect thousands of homes and businesses.

UK – Weather Radar Deployed in Cumbria to Improve Flood Forecasting,"27 November, 2018","The Environment Agency and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) have successfully deployed a mobile weather radar in Cumbria. For the next 12 months, the NCAS X-band radar will provide data that will help improve the Environment Agency’s rainfall detection capability and should lead to an improvement in our flood forecasting and warning services. The deployment is a collaborative research project between the Environment Agency, the University of Leeds and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, called Radar Applications in Northern England (RAIN-E). Tim Harrison, Senior Advisor for the Environment Agency said, “The deployment of the NCAS radar will help us to build a strong case for investment where it’s needed. We’re seeing many benefits from the collaboration including a greater interest from all parties to integrate data from deployments like this, and other third party radars into the national Met Office rainfall products.” The radar will be used to improve the weather radar coverage in north Cumbria for up to a year and provide information to support the development of a long term weather solution for Cumbria. The radar will also be used to further understand the challenges associated with collecting high quality data over mountainous terrain and learn more about bringing multiple sources of rainfall data into the national weather radar Weather radars are the most effective way to collect real-time rainfall information and NCAS operates the only mobile weather radar in the UK. The radar measures rain, wind and other parameters. Importantly, the location of the radar will improve the observations of rainfall over Cumbria, helping to make flood forecasting in the area more accurate. Data collected by the radar will provide evidence for the need to invest in a permanent solution and help researchers better understand the type of extreme rainfall that sometimes affects Cumbria. A separate partnership project between the Environment Agency, Met Office, National Resources Wales, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Department of Infrastructure Northern Ireland is developing a national strategy for the UK’s radar network over the next 15 years and data from the radar will help to support the development of a long term radar solution in Cumbria. Ryan Neely and Lindsay Bennett, scientists at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science said “We are happy to be working with the Environment Agency to provide them with high resolution data in this under-observed region so that they may improve their flood forecasts.

UK – Coastal Flood Protection in England “Not Fit for Purpose”,"30 October, 2018","A new, long-term approach to coastal management in England is urgently needed given the expected impacts of climate change, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says. Climate change will almost certainly cause sea levels around the UK to increase by 1 metre or more at some point in the future, and this could happen as early as 2100 – within the lifetimes of today’s children. In a new report, ‘Managing the coast in a changing climate’, the Committee finds that coastal communities, infrastructure and landscapes in England are already under significant pressure from flooding and erosion. These threats will increase in the future. As a result, some coastal communities and infrastructure are unlikely to be viable in their current form. This problem is not currently being confronted with the required urgency or openness, the Committee’s report shows. Long-term action to adapt England’s coasts to climate change in a sustainable way is possible and could deliver multiple benefits. However, the Committee finds that plans for the coast are not realistic about the implications of climate change, and are not backed up with funding or legislation. The report, by the CCC’s Adaptation Committee, highlights that: The Committee makes five recommendations to the authorities involved in managing England’s coasts: Professor Jim Hall, the CCC Adaptation Committee’s expert on flooding and coastal erosion, said: “As the climate changes the current approach to protecting the English coastline is not fit for purpose. It’s time people woke up to the very real challenges ahead.

UK – Heavy Rain From Storm Callum Causes Major Flooding in Wales,"14 October, 2018","At least 2 people died as Storm Callum swept across parts of the UK over the weekend, 12 to 14 October, 2018. The storm brought winds of over 70 mph (112 km/h), high waves and torrential rain. Some areas of Wales recorded over a month’s worth of rain during the storm. Libanus in the Brecon Beacons, south Wales, recorded 198mm of rain in a 36 hour period, above the October monthly average of 146mm. The heavy rain caused rivers to overflow and wide areas of Wales were badly affected by floods. By 13 October there were 46 Flood Alerts and 31 Flood Warnings in place in Wales. Homes and businesses were damaged and rail and road travel severely disrupted, with Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and south Powys the worst affected. Natural Resources Wales said river levels have been amongst the highest seen in south west Wales for many years and some of the flooding in Carmarthenshire was the worst for 30 years. Rivers reached record levels in at least 4 locations; the Tywi at Capel Dewi and also at Pothouse Wharf, the Teifi at Llanfair and the Gwili at Glan Gwili. Two people died as a result of the storm. A man was swept into rough seas in Brighton, East Sussex. Another man died in a landslide on a road in Cwmduad, Carmarthenshire on Saturday, 13 October. Flooding was also seen in some parts of South West England. Flooding damaged rail tracks near the Teignmouth Estuary in Devon. Rail services between Penzance and Exeter were suspended as rough seas crashed over the track. Rainfall totals for the last 72 hours until 1pm Sunday Oct 14th. Some places such as Libanus in Powys have had a lot more. The number of flood warnings and flood alerts is falling.

"As Climate Risks Surge, Flood Barriers Rise in Britain","7 September, 2018","The risks of tidal flooding are worsening across much of Britain – and that is leading to more protective barriers being put in place, by Claudio Accheri and Laurie Goering for the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  LONDON, Sept 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Four decades ago, when storms blew in the North Sea and sent high tides surging toward London, sirens sounded in the city. “People were told not to work or sleep in basements. They used to move buses to higher ground. All these contingency plans had to be in place,” remembers Steve East, an engineering manager for the British Environment Agency. But since 1982, when the Thames Barrier – London’s pioneering flood protection wall – came into use, central Londoners have scarcely had to think about flood risks. “Today if London is threatened by a tidal surge, we stop the surge here and London carries on with its normal day-to-day business,” said East, the engineering manager for the barrier, which spans the Thames in Woolwich in southeast London. As climate change brings more extreme rainfall, higher tides and stronger storms, flood risks are rising across Britain – and flood protection barriers are rising as well. Ipswich in eastern England will put into operation its first tidal barrier this winter, part of a 66-million-pound ($86-million) flood protection system designed to defend the town against growing threats, officials there say. Other British towns, including the east coast port of Boston, are planning barriers of their own, said Andrew Usborne, the project manager for the Ipswich barrier, on the River Orwell. The moveable barriers – which retract into the riverbed floor when not in use and are raised only when needed – are being built not just because of rising risks but because they increasingly make financial sense, Usborne said. In Ipswich, “this was the cheapest and preferred option,” he said. Walls built along the waterfront, long used to protect the city, now need to be raised to meet growing risks “but nobody’s ever going to accept a metre of wall all through the centre of town”, he said. The new barrier, which sits on piles driven 60m (66 yards) into the chalky soil, will protect about 1,200 homes and more than 400 businesses from the kind of storm expected to hit every 300 years, he said – and rising climate change risks have been taken into account. Across Britain, “where it is financially and technically appropriate, like here, we will have barriers,” he predicted. London’s Thames Barrier – a 520m span of steel gates, piers and abutments that looks as if it might have been inspired by the Sydney Opera House – has now been used more than 180 times to protect central London from tidal floods, East said. The rate of use has been increasing – at one point, it was closed on 24 consecutive tides – but that increasing crescendo of closures “was always expected,” the engineer said. The structure was designed to last until 2030 – but assessments suggest it will now last until 2070, when a new barrier will need to be put in place, he said. For now, however, the barrier remains an effective bulwark, keeping 1.25 million Londoners – and 300 billion pounds worth of infrastructure – above the rising tide, officials say. “Until the 1920s, people actually died in floods in central London – and the real catalyst for the Thames Barrier and the rest of the tidal defence system was the floods of 1953, where over 350 people died,” East said. “That was a wake-up call to the government that they had to come up with a solution,” he said.

UK – 1 Man Dead as Severe Floods Hit West Midlands and Wales,"28 May, 2018","A stormy holiday weekend (26 to 28 May, 2018) in the UK saw 136,000 lightning strikes across the country, along with heavy rainfall and flooding in the West Midlands and parts of Wales. Police say that an elderly man has died after his car was submerged in water during the flooding in Rushall, an area of Walsall in the West Midlands, about 15 km north of Birmingham. In a statement, West Midlands Police said “A man has died after his vehicle was submerged in flood water in Walsall following flash flooding that hit the region. Police were called to Lichfield Road, Rushall, just after 2am today (Monday 28 May) to reports that a vehicle had entered the water. The victim, who is believed to be in his 80s, was taken to hospital but pronounced dead a short time later.” A number of roads in the Birmingham area, including Walsall, were badly affected by the flooding after torrential rain fell overnight. Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service (WFRS) said their control room was extremely busy dealing with flooding calls and crews have visited many properties to assist where they can with flooding. WFRS Technical Rescue Unit said they carried out multiple rescues from cars, buses and homes. WFRS asked people to avoid the areas of Flecknoe, Willoughby and Lower Shuckburgh which were affected by fast flowing water late on 27 May. Warwickshire police reported flooding in the Lapworth and Hockley Heath areas, Lower Shuckburgh, Earlswood Lakes and Rugby. Five buildings in Warwickshire were struck by lightning during the storm. Flood water up to 1 metre was reported in Welshpool, Powys, about 75 km west of Walsall and flooded areas of Birmingham. Homes, roads and vehicles were damaged as well as the Victoria Memorial Hospital, according to local media. The UK’s Met Office said that Winterbourne in Edgbaston (Birmingham), recorded 53.6 mm of rainfall in just one hour on Sunday afternoon, and 93.6 mm in a 24-hour period. The May monthly average for the area is around 55 mm. Bala in Gwynedd, about 40 km north west of Welshpool, recorded 54 mm of rain in 24 hours. The Met Office had issued an Orange (mid-level) warning for heavy rain across a narrow patch over North Wales and the West Midlands.

UK Must Build Flood Resilient Homes Says Architects Institute,"4 May, 2018","The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) says that the UK the government needs to do to help create homes and communities that are resilient to flood damage. RIBA’s The Value of Flood Resilient Architecture and Design report (pdf) calls for innovation and regulation change, to ensure both new build and existing properties are flood resilient and future proof. Currently 1 in 6 homes in the UK are at risk of flooding and this number is expected to double by 2050. Furthermore, flooding causes an average of £1.4 billion of damage each year to businesses and households. RIBA President Ben Derbyshire said, “In the next 30 years, the number of homes at risk of flooding is expected to double. Now is the time to adapt and think creatively about how to tackle this threat. The RIBA urges the government to step up and encourage the collaboration and innovation needed to create new homes and communities that are resilient to the devastating effects of flooding.” The report stresses that the UK can no longer base its approach to managing flood risk on simply keeping the water out. The government needs to enable communities to manage their risks. This means better equipping people and businesses to live with water; being able to stop water entering their properties and speeding recovery if it does. The RIBA report advocates building flood resilient homes and buildings. To do this it recommends that the government develops a new approach to decision-making and regulation in tackling flooding threats, encourages innovation in flooding resilience in the housing and urban design sector, and introduces specific building regulations for flood resilience and resistance – ensuring that these are taken up by any building owner exposed to flood risk. The report concludes that embedding flood resilient design will help future-proof new developments and deliver greater value for money when investments in new flood defences are made. In addition, there is room for the UK to become a leader in this area, paving the way with innovative responses and solutions to flooding.

UK – Flood Rescues After Heavy Rain and Snow,"4 April, 2018","Snow and heavy downpours closed roads and caused travel disruption throughout the holiday weekend of 31 March to 02 April in the UK. Emergency services were called on rescue at least 8 people trapped in flood waters. Up to 10cm (4ins) of snow blanketed areas of north England, north Wales and Scotland. The UK Met Office also issued several “be aware” yellow warnings for rain, mostly in central and southern England. At one point on 02 April there were 271 flood alerts in place, along with 40 flood warnings in England. Natural Resources Wales issued one flood warning and 19 flood alerts in place for Wales. In Warwickshire, Fire and Rescue Service said “Four people have had to be rescued from their vehicles this weekend after getting trapped in flood water. Please don’t put your life or the lives of others at risk by driving through flood water.” The incidents occurred in Hill Wootton and Wolston, Warwickshire. Road surface flooding was reported in several parts of the East Midlands in England, with the towns of Lambley and Colston Bassett in Nottinghamshire among the worst affected. Severe flooding was reported in the St Ives area of Cambridgeshire when the River Great Ouse broke its banks. In the South West, Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said they received numerous calls related to the weather conditions on 01 April. The next day the service reported “a busy night attending multiple flooding incidents throughout the county.” Spring tide flooding affected the coastal village of Mevagissey, near St Austell, Cornwall, where roads were closed, leaving some residents unable to reach their homes, according to local media. In Gloucestershire, 4 people were rescued after becoming trapped by flood water in 2 separate incidents in Quedgeley and Alney Island. A lane of the M5 motorway in Stroud was closed due to flooding. In the North, flood sirens were sounded after river levels increased in the Calder Valley Area. The area, which includes the towns of Todmorden and Hebden Bridge, has suffered numerous incidents of flooding over the last few years. However this time thankfully the rivers stayed in the banks although some surface flooding was reported. Later, Calderdale Council said “The situation is easing across Calderdale with surface water receding and river levels not expected to rise. We will be monitoring through the night but any forecasted rain is expected to be light, so no further issues are anticipated.” Meanwhile in York, the River Ouse is expected to continue rising until late 04 April, possibly peaking at 3.8 metres. The Foss flood barrier has been closed.

UK – Flood Protection Boost With £36m of Funding,"29 March, 2018","In the UK, the Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey announced on 27 March that 25 new schemes will receive a share of £36 million funding to improve flood protection. Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey said, “This funding will benefit projects across the country from Hull to Gloucester, from Wolverhampton to the Wirral, that need an extra boost for flood defences to help our communities continue to prosper and grow in the future.” One of the biggest beneficiaries is Hull, where £12 million will improve the defences along the River Hull to protect homes, businesses, infrastructure and areas of cultural importance within the city. The funding will support the second phase of the project which started in 2016 and has so far seen 39 sections of defence improved over a 7.5km stretch of river. The main pier at Seahouses, Berwick-upon-Tweed, protecting 140 properties and the town’s picturesque harbour, will be regenerated thanks to an extra £2.9 million. Rivers will be restored and habitat improved in Gloucester, where £1.2 million will go to projects to protect 370 properties along the Sud Brook and River Twyer. In Derby, more than £300,000 will help create new wetlands and flood reservoirs to not only protect 110 homes from flooding but also enhance biodiversity in residential areas. “Not only will this investment make places more resilient against flooding, but it will help the local economy, enhance the natural environment and protect important areas of culture – whether it is the homes, businesses and cultural sites in Hull to the pier in Seahouses or the natural environment in Gloucester,” the Environment Minister added. The government has worked with the Environment Agency to prioritise the areas that would get the most benefit – the schemes will not only protect an additional 3,000 properties from flooding but will contribute to wider benefits for the community. Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, said, “In the face of challenges like a changing climate, rising sea levels and more severe weather, the Environment Agency is working hard to protect people, homes and businesses from flooding.” “As with every project we undertake, we’re also striving to improve our environment and this additional funding will not only help us build flood defences, but restore vital habitat and bring nature back to some of our urban communities.” This recent funding brings the total investment in flood defence to £2.6 billion by 2021, when more than 1,500 flood defences will have been built to protect 300,000 homes up and down the country. Over the past two years, the Environment Agency has completed more than 350 new flood schemes to protect 100,000 homes. In addition to building hard defences, it has improved its response by investing in new technology and equipment like temporary flood barriers, pumps and 6,500 trained staff across the country.

UK – Different Approach to Floods Needed in Future Says Environment Agency,"20 March, 2018","The UK Environment Agency’s Chief Executive Sir James Bevan has highlighted the need for a new approach in his keynote speech at a conference on flooding and coastal erosion in the UK. Over the next century a different approach is needed to protect the country from flooding, the Environment Agency’s Chief Executive said in a keynote speech at the annual Flood and Coast Conference today, Tuesday 20 March, 2018. As he revealed that every £1 invested in new flood schemes saves the economy £10 in damages avoided, Sir James Bevan said that despite huge advances in flood protection, what worked so well in the past will not be enough in the future. Rising sea levels and higher populations in built-up areas will mean new approaches are needed to combat increasing flood risk. Since 2015, new flood schemes completed by the Environment Agency have benefited more than 100,000 homes but to continue building on this success new 21st century approaches are needed. These include a call for greater business investment, quicker emergency response and increased use of natural flood schemes, in addition to ‘hard’ defences, in order to reduce the impact of flooding on communities around the country. He questioned how these challenges should be dealt with and suggest that more concrete – simply building our flood defences higher and higher – is not the answer. As he laid out his thoughts on the future of flood protection, Sir James Bevan said that tough questions had to be asked about what to protect. He questioned whether there might be a case for considering future funding priorities. He said that everyone has a part to play to reduce flood risk and that homeowners in flood risk areas should know the risks and what action they can take – and he praised communities and flood groups who have already taken great steps in this area. “Almost every day in this country, when rivers and tides rise, rain falls and storms blow, thousands of people sleep safe and unaware that they are being protected by flood defences,” said Sir James. “But what works so well now – and has done in the past – may not be enough in the future. Over the next fifty years if we are going to give the country the best possible protection against flooding, we are going to need a different approach,” he added. The Environment Agency manages flood risk on over 36,000 km of river, 9,000km raised flood defences and over 22,000 flood structures – from the Thames Barrier to local pumping stations. Since 2016, it has upgraded its response capability with more than 6,500 staff trained and ready to help protect communities when floods threaten, 40km of temporary barriers, 250 mobile pumps, and 500,000 sandbags. Partnerships to help respond during incidents have also been strengthened – including with the army. Government is investing £2.6 billion in flood and coastal erosion risk management projects between 2015 and 2021.

UK – Homes at Risk From Coastal Erosion Are Evacuated,"20 March, 2018","Several houses in an area along England’s east coast have been evacuated after erosion brought them perilously close to the edge of a cliff. The foundations of some of the houses, located in an area known as The Marrams near the town of Hemsby, Norfolk, have been exposed. The situation was made worse by the run of winter storms seen in the UK over recent weeks. The BBC said that a 6 metre high dune has been completely eroded. Home owners report losing 4 or 5 metres of their gardens due to storms over the weekend 17 to 18 March, 2018. Norfolk Police said on 17 March that “a total of 10 homes at risk from coastal erosion evacuated in Hemsby today in multi-agency response. Thanks to local businesses who offered help & support to those affected. The Marrams has been closed for the safety of the public and officers will remain on scene overnight.” Norfolk Council said 18 March “We’re urging people to stay away from The Marrams in Hemsby and nearby sand dunes over the coming days as the area remains dangerous due to coastal erosion.” Area along this stretch of coastline have suffered coastal erosion over recent years.

Study Finds Floods Wash Microplastics From Polluted Rivers Into Sea,"13 March, 2018","A study has found that microplastics are shifted into the seas from polluted rivers particularly after flooding.  Researchers from the University of Manchester are calling for tighter regulations on waste flowing into urban waterways, after the first study of its kind found that microplastics from urban river channels are a major contributor to the pollution problem in the oceans. “Microplastics in the ocean have recently attracted a lot of attention, but until now science knew little about the major sources of this pollution and the transport processes involved,” said Professor Jamie Woodward, the University’s Head of Geography. “We decided to explore the contamination of urban river beds, as we began to think that they may be the main source of the problem.” Microplastics are very small pieces of plastic debris including microbeads, microfibres and plastic fragments which enter river systems from multiple sources including industrial effluent, storm water drains and domestic wastewater. These particles pollute the environment and pose a threat to ecosystem health. Although around 90% of microplastic contamination in the oceans is thought to originate from land, not much is known about their storage and movements in river basins. In the first detailed catchment-wide study anywhere in the world, Rachel Hurley, Jamie Woodward and James Rothwell from the Department of Geography at The University of Manchester examined the microplastics in river sediments from 40 sites across Greater Manchester, including rural streams in the hills and urban rivers in the city centre. They discovered microplastic contamination in all parts of the network – including a site on the River Tame at Denton which had the highest levels so far recorded anywhere in the world. Following a period of major flooding, the researchers resampled at all of the sites – levels of contamination had fallen at the majority of them, and the flooding had removed about 70% of the microplastics stored on the river beds. This demonstrates that flood events can transfer large quantities of microplastics from urban rivers to the oceans. Professor Jamie Woodward, the University’s Head of Geography, said: “We are only beginning to understand the extent of the microplastic contamination problem in the world’s rivers. To tackle the problem in the oceans, we have to prevent microplastics entering river channels. We also need to reduce our use of plastics large and small. We welcome the microbead ban introduced by Michael Gove earlier this year, and we hope that improvements in wastewater management will be put in place in the future.”",https://floodlist.com/europe/united-kingdom/floods-wash-plastic-from-polluted-rivers-to-oceans,0,,,,,False,False,False,OtherFlood (no numerics)

UK – Two-Thirds of Motorists Would Risk Their Lives in a Flood,"20 February, 2018","A shocking two-thirds of drivers would gamble with their safety by driving through floodwater – even though this is the leading cause of death during a flood, new figures have revealed. In a survey commissioned by the UK’s Environment Agency and the AA (Automobile Association – a British motoring association), 68% of motorists admitted they’d take the risk rather than find a safer route. The alarming figures emerge as the Environment Agency runs its campaign warning people across the country to be prepared for flooding in advance by checking their risk and signing up for free warnings The AA has rescued more than 14,500 drivers from floods since 2013 with the top spot being Rufford Lane in Newark, Nottinghamshire, where over 100 rescues have been carried out in the last 5 years. Driving through floodwater puts the lives of drivers and their passengers on the line, risks the safety of emergency responders, and often causes serious damage to the vehicle, with three-quarters of flood-damaged cars ultimately being written off. Caroline Douglass, Director of Incident Management and Resilience at the Environment Agency, said: The results of this survey are extremely concerning – no one should put their own life or those of their friends and family at risk during a flood. Just 30cm of water can float a family car, and smaller cars take even less. If you’re driving long distances this winter, please check online for any flood warnings in force along your route, and if you find your way blocked by floodwater, never take the risk – turn around and find another way. Vince Crane, AA Patrol of the Year, said: If the road ahead is flooded, don’t chance it – flood water can be deceptively deep and can mask other hazards on the road. It only takes an egg-cupful of water to be sucked into your engine to wreck it and on many cars, the engine’s air intake is low down at the front. As well as the damage to your car, attempting to drive through flood water puts you and your passengers in danger – so it’s just not worth the risk. 5.2 million homes and businesses in England are at risk of flooding. This winter the Environment Agency is encouraging people to be prepared and stay safe during flooding by checking their flood risk online.

"Climate Change Means More Frequent Flooding, Warns UK Environment Agency","16 February, 2018","Intense bouts of flooding are set to become more frequent, the Environment Agency in the UK has warned. The warning follows a pattern of severe flooding over the past 10 years linked to an increase in extreme weather events as the country’s climate changes. Met Office records show that since 1910 there have been 17 record breaking rainfall months or seasons – with 9 of them since 2000. As intense storms are becoming more frequent, sea levels are also rising because of climate change. The Environment Agency has today launched its Flood Action Campaign, targeting younger people through social media and online advertising to encourage them to check their flood risk at GOV.UK, sign up for free warnings and be prepared to take action when flooding hits. Research shows that 18 to 34 year olds are least likely to perceive flood risk to their area, know how to protect their homes or where to go for information. They are also at highest risk of fatality as they are less likely to perceive their personal risk. Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, said: Climate change is likely to mean more frequent and intense flooding. Floods destroy – lives, livelihoods, and property. Our flood defences reduce the risk of flooding, and our flood warnings help keep communities safe when it threatens. But we can never entirely eliminate the risk of flooding. Checking your flood risk is the first step to protecting yourself, your loved ones and your home. In summer 2012, the lengthy period of drought the country had experienced came to an abrupt end when prolonged and intense rainfall increased the risk of flooding from rivers and surface water for long periods. Almost 8,000 homes and businesses were flooded across the country, particularly in the south west. The winter of 2013 to 2014 started with a coastal surge and record sea levels on the north and east coasts. This was followed by 12 storms in succession and became the wettest winter for 250 years – 11,000 homes were flooded. Winter 2015 to 2016 brought widespread flooding to 17,000 properties across the north of England, with named storms Desmond, Eva and Frank causing December 2015 to be the wettest month ever recorded. The threat of flooding is real and increasing – as is also demonstrated by its listing as one of the nation’s major threats. Last year, the Met Office published new innovative research which found that for England and Wales there is a 1 in 3 chance of a new monthly rainfall record in at least one region each winter. By their very nature extreme events are rare and a novel research method was needed to quantify the risk of extreme rainfall within the current climate. Professor Adam Scaife, who leads this area of research at the Met Office, said: “The Met Office supercomputer was used to simulate thousands of possible winters, some of them much more extreme than we’ve yet witnessed. This gave many more extreme events than have happened in the real world, helping us work out how severe things could get.” Featured image: Floods in Carlisle, Cumbria, England, December 2015.

UK – Warrington’s £34 Million Flood Defence Scheme Officially Complete,"1 February, 2018","More than 2,000 homes and businesses in Warrington, England, will benefit from the town’s multi-million pound flood defence scheme, officially opened on 26 January, 2018, by Environment Agency Chief Executive, Sir James Bevan and the town’s Mayor, Councillor Les Morgan. The scheme is one of the largest value flood defence projects constructed in the region in recent times, and will significantly reduce flood risk to the town which has been no stranger to flooding – given it sits in naturally low-lying land and within the path of the River Mersey and its tributaries. Comprising 5km of flood walls and 2.2km of embankment, the 7.2km scheme has improved amenity and recreational opportunities, as well as habitat conditions along the river corridor. Floods Minister Thérèse Coffey said, “Warrington’s new £34 million flood scheme will reduce the flood risk to over 2,000 homes and businesses, and protect vital infrastructure helping to bring investment to the area. “This scheme is an excellent example of how working together with councils and local businesses allows us to make the most of government funding to secure the best possible defences for communities. By 2021, we will have invested £47 million in flood defences to better protect 4,280 homes in Cheshire.”  England",https://floodlist.com/protection/uk-warrington-flood-defence-scheme,0,,,,"England, Cheshire, Warrington",False,False,False,OtherFlood (no numerics)
UK – Evacuations and Rescues After Storm Henk Leaves Widespread Flooding,"4 January, 2024","Heavy rain from consecutive storms, most recently Storm Henk, has left wide areas of the United Kingdom under water once again. Dozens of people have been rescued from vehicles trapped in flood waters. Firefighters and police have also carried out evacuations in parts of Northamptonshire and Worcestershire. Ground has been saturated for some time across the UK following a series of winter storms. Storm Henk comes just days after Storm Gerrit hit in late December 2023. Storm Babet flooded thousands of homes in October 2023. In the last days of 2023, parts of Scotland and northern England suffered as a result of strong winds and heavy rain brought by Storm Gerrit. Several roads were closed in North Yorkshire where flooding and severe weather were blamed for the deaths of 3 people trapped in a vehicle in the River Esk near the town of Glaisdale on 28 December 2023. Firefighters also rescued people from vehicles trapped in floods in nearby Houlsyke and Kirby Wiske. In the following days the overflowing River Ouse flooded roads and left the village of Naburn isolated. Further south, heavy rain flooded a railway tunnel in Kent, England, severely interrupting Eurostar services between London and Paris. Roads were flooded in parts of Essex where 2 people were rescued after vehicles became trapped. The UK Met Office warned Storm Henk would bring further severe weather including strong winds and heavy rain from 02 January 2024. Wide areas of England and Wales recorded more than 40 mm of rain in 24 hours. River levels increased and the Environment Agency issued more than 250 flood warnings for areas of England. By 02 January dozens of roads were reported flooded in areas of of the West Midlands, East Midlands and East Anglia. Firefighters and police carried out flood rescues in Shropshire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire, among others. Bystanders rescued a child and driver from a car sinking in floodwater under a bridge over the River Cole near Sarehole Mill museum in Birmingham. Authorities reported people were evacuated from a caravan park in Great Billing, Northampton, following the rise of the Nene River. Levels of the river at the measuring gauge at Nene Valley jumped to 1.63 metres on 03 January, 2024, just 1 cm below the record high seen on 24 December 2020. Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) said, “Twenty-nine adults and two children, along with a number of pets have been evacuated today as part of the rescue operations. Crews are continuing to carry out a systematic search of the 1,750 static homes. They have made contact with and evacuated everyone who wanted to leave, however, a small number of residents have chosen to remain in their properties.” Northamptonshire Police said a further evacuation of around 130 people who remained in caravans on the Billing Aquadrome site would take place on 03 January. As is often the case following heavy rain in England and Wales, the Severn river rose to dangerously high levels. Temporary flood defences were raised along the banks of the river in several locations including Bewdley and Shrewsbury. The BBC reported hundreds of properties near the Severn in the West Midlands were flooded, in some cases for the fourth time this winter. Areas of the city of Worcester were flooded and some homes were evacuated. Flood waters from the Severn and Avon rivers surrounded the town of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire. Storm Henk is the first named storm of 2024 in the UK and the eighth so far this winter. Strong winds from the storm also caused widespread damage. One person died after a tree fell on a vehicle near Kemble in Gloucestershire. The Energy Networks Association reported power outages affected 107,000 homes during the peak of the storm. The Met Office issued further warnings for heavy rain across the south of England from 04 to 05 January. As of 04 January, 273 flood warnings (flooding is expected) and 294 flood alerts (flooding is possible) were in place across England.

UK – Government Declares Major Incident Over Flood Risk in Somerset,"19 January, 2023","The government in the UK has declared a major incident over flood risk in the southwestern county of Somerset, England. England’s Environment Agency (EA) in partnership with local authorities has taken a decision to declare a major incident on the Somerset Levels to ensure local partners can take a coordinated response to recent flooding. The EA stressed that this is a precautionary move and imminent flooding to properties is not expected, however, the risk of flooding will remain for the coming week. The Somerset Levels and Moors are designed to store flood water when the rivers flowing through them overtop. The recent heavy rain in England caused spillways (specifically designed low points in the riverbanks) on the Rivers Tone and Parrett to overflow and the excess water is stored on the moors. The area has suffered major flooding in recent years, most notably during the winter of 2013 to 2014. A pumping operation started last week and additional pumps were deployed on 17 January at Northmoor to reduce the amount of water being stored at Currymoor. The EA expects water levels to reduce in Northmoor, Saltmoor and Currymoor now that river levels have dropped low enough to allow pumping. But declaring a major incident is a sensible step so partners can stay coordinated and ready to respond should the situation worsen. Ian Withers of the Environment Agency said, “The sight of water on the Somerset Levels and Moors is obviously a concern to those who have suffered from flooding before. Our staff continue to work to the best of their abilities to protect people and properties, install pumps and engage with communities. “The situation is expected to improve when enhanced pumping begins and we continue to run the Sowy flood relief channel, it is prudent to plan for the worst and going into major incident mode is appropriate, so we coordinate with partners and everyone is ready to respond if needed.” A period of heavy rain that began around 09 January 2023 caused rivers to rise in several parts of England and Wales. The Environment Agency installed temporary flood barriers along rising rivers at Bewdley in Worcestershire and in Ironbridge and Shrewsbury in Shropshire, among others. The Environment Agency said that a total of 130 properties across England suffered flood damage across the country. However, over 5,000 properties were protected across the West Midlands, Yorkshire, in the South West and along the Thames. As of 18 January, the Environment Agency teams were responding to flooding incidents in Somerset, flood risk in the Bristol Avon area and monitoring rising groundwater levels in Dorset. Below is a selection of some of the significant river levels seen in parts of England from 12 to 15 January 2023.

"Trees and Woodlands Delivering £400m Boost to UK’s Flood Protection Efforts, Study Finds","16 January, 2023","New research by Forest Research estimates Great Britain’s trees contribute over £400m annually in benefits in the fight against floods. Trees and woodlands have long been known to play a vital role in flood resilience, but scientists are now able to establish the financial contribution they make in protecting communities from flooding. The flood regulation service of Great Britain’s trees, forests and woodlands as an annualised central estimate gave annual values of £843 million and £420 million compared to bare soil and grass, respectively. The valuation is based on the role trees, woodlands and forests play in intercepting rainfall, storing water and reducing the potentially devastating surface runoff that causes flooding. Given the increased likelihood and frequency of extreme weather events as a result of climate change, the report highlights how woodland expansion can be a natural, cost-effective method of protecting homes and businesses – now and for the future. Forestry Minister Trudy Harrison said, “Communities across the country know all too well the potentially devastating impacts of flooding – from damage to homes and businesses and the disruption of critical infrastructure to the tragic loss of life. “This report provides the best picture yet of the integral role that our trees, woodlands and forests play in protecting at-risk communities from flooding. With more severe weather events forecast in the future, there is even more incentive to accelerate our tree planting efforts in line with our ambitious target to treble planting rates in England.” Forests help to reduce flooding in numerous ways, in what is referred to as a ‘sponge effect’. Firstly, evaporation from leaves and branches helps to reduce the amount of rainfall reaching the ground. This process, known as interception, is significantly greater for woodland compared to other land use types. Secondly, the soils within forests receive, store and delay water, helping to reduce rapid run-off and peak flows. Finally, the presence of trees, shrubs and large woody dams along rivers and on the floodplain creates a barrier effect that slows the passage of flood waters downstream, in addition to delivering biodiversity benefits. As a result, tree planting can significantly affect the volume, pathway and timing of surface run-off, reducing the risk of downstream flooding. Responsible forestry management practices help to maintain and secure this key environmental service. Environment Agency Chief Executive, Sir James Bevan said, “The warning signs of the climate crisis are stark and mounting – with greater rainfall, higher tides and more violent weather bringing heightened risks of serious flooding over the years ahead. The hard flood defences which the Environment Agency builds and maintains all across the country are part of the solution. So too are Natural Flood Management techniques such as tree planting, which we are already using to slow the flow of water and help protect homes and businesses. “By harnessing the power of nature, we can tackle the twin challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change – whilst simultaneously reducing the risk of flooding to vulnerable communities.” The full study is available here.

England’s Environment Agency Emphasizes Importance of Natural Flood Management,"9 December, 2022","The Chief Executive of the Environment Agency (EA) in England, UK has emphasized the importance of natural flood management in the fight against growing flood risk and climate change. In a report published by the Environment Agency, Chief Executive Sir James Bevan outlined his vision for natural flood management to be seen as a core part of the nation’s defence against flooding, alongside its programme of “crucial bricks and mortar hard defences”. The report evaluates the impact of the national Natural Flood Management Program, which received £15 million in government funding, and found that it had created an equivalent of 1.6 million cubic meters of water storage and increased flood resilience to 15,000 homes. In addition, the programme contributed to nature recovery: improving 4,000 hectares of habitat, improving 610 kilometres of river and planting 100 hectares of woodland. Sir James Bevan said, “The warning signs of the climate crisis are stark – and sadly devastating flooding is likely to become a more familiar sight over the next century. “As we prepare for more extreme weather events, we must use every weapon in our armoury and Natural Flood Management will play an essential role in this. “By harnessing the power of nature alongside our traditional flood defences, we can not only help keep communities safer but also create wildlife havens and tackle the climate emergency.” Natural flood management (NFM) helps to slow the flow of water across the landscape – including the re-meandering of rivers, the restoration of wetlands and targeted woodland planting. NFM measures include planting trees and hedges to absorb more water, creating leaky barriers to slow water flow in streams and ditches and restoring salt marshes, mudflats, and peat bogs. Examples can be found in Somerset and Yorkshire. In fact between 2017 and 2021, EA invested £15 million of government funding to benefit people and learn more about NFM through 60 pilots across England. Of these, 26 were catchment scale pilots led by risk management authorities and 34 were community scale pilots led by local groups and charities (see map). Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said, “We know that flooding can have a devastating impact on people’s lives, homes and livelihoods. That is why we are investing a record £5.2 billion in flood and coastal defences to ensure more communities are better prepared – and nature-based solutions are a key component of this. “The additional benefits of Natural Flood Management for people and wildlife are vast – helping us reach our ambitious Net Zero targets, providing vital new habitats and creating areas of natural beauty for people to enjoy for generations to come.” EnglandGreen InfrastructureLow Impact DevelopmentSustainable Drainage Systems",https://floodlist.com/protection/englands-environment-agency-natural-flood-management,0,,,,"England, woodland, Somerset, UK",False,False,False,OtherFlood (no numerics)
UK’s Climate is Getting Warmer and Wetter Says Met Office,"2 August, 2021","The Met Office says the UK is getting warmer and sunnier but also wetter as a result of climate change. 2020 was third warmest, fifth wettest and eighth sunniest on record for the UK. The latest analysis of the UK climate, State of the UK Climate 2020 published in The Royal Meteorological Society’s ‘International Journal of Climatology’, has shown that climate change is already being felt across the UK. All of the top-ten warmest years for the UK in records back to 1884 have occurred since 2002, and, for central England, the 21st century so far has been warmer than the previous three centuries. Lead author and Senior Climate Scientist at the Met Office, Mike Kendon, said: “2020 was another notable year for the UK climate, with records broken for daily rainfall and monthly sunshine hours. Average temperatures for the UK continue to climb, with nearly a degree of warming when comparing the most recent 30 years with the preceding 30-year period. Last year saw some significant weather extremes including severe flooding from heavy rainfall in February and a major heatwave in early August.” The last 30-year period (1991-2020) has been 0.9°C warmer than the preceding 30 years (1961-1990). The warming trend is evident across all months and all countries in the UK. As well as increased temperatures, the UK has been on average 6% wetter over the last 30 years (1991-2020) than the preceding 30 years (1961-1990). Six of the ten wettest years for the UK in a series from 1862 have occurred since 1998. Storms Ciara and Dennis, hitting the UK only one week apart, were part of the UK’s wettest February on record, and brought devastating flooding affecting many homes and businesses. Most of the UK received more than twice the February long-term average rainfall, with 300% quite widely in the north and west, and over 400% in parts of the Pennines. The UK has had its wettest February in 2020, December in 2015, April and June in 2012 and November in 2009 – five out of 12 months – in little over a decade.  The average sea-surface temperature in 2020 for near-coast waters around the UK was 11.9°C, 0.5°C above the 1981-2010 long-term average. This was the eighth-warmest year for UK near-coast sea-surface temperatures in records dating back to 1870. In the most recent decade (2011-2020) sea-surface temperatures have been 0.7°C warmer than the 1961–1990 average, and nine of the ten warmest years in near-coast sea-surface temperatures have occurred since 2002. Sea level rise has accelerated in the UK over recent years. The rate of sea level rise has been 1.5mm/yr from the start of the 20th century, however, for the period 1993-2019 it has increased to over 3mm/yr.

Japan’s Experience With Earthquakes Can Help Teach Us to Learn to Live With Floods,"17 March, 2020","The intense rainfall from storms this winter has caused severe flooding in numerous cities across the UK. The storms have left at least eight people dead, and economic losses have been estimated at a few billion pounds. The government has responded by announcing flood defence spending will be doubled to £5.2 billion pounds over the next five years. Such severe flooding may seem like a rare event, but – as those living in the most flood-prone areas will tell you – it is not. There was flooding to a similar if not greater extent between December 2013 and January 2014, which killed 17 people and cost £1.3 billion in economic losses. At the time the Met Office reported that it was the wettest Dececember-January period on record. There was also major flooding across the UK in 2016, and previously in 2009, 2007 and 2000, and flooding of lesser extent in other years as well. What this suggests is that regularity of major flooding in the UK has dropped from every 15 to 30 years as it was over the 20th century, to between every two to seven years today. More frequent major flooding puts unprecedented pressure on flood defences, with insufficient time and resources to recover between major events as in the past. We need to acknowledge that in the UK – as is the case elsewhere – flood defences are 20th century approaches now ill-suited to tackle what the 21st century is throwing at us. Civil engineers have usually been employed to build “hard” structural solutions, such as more and higher concrete walls and soil embankments around rivers. But this may no longer be the best approach in the face of the recurring intense weather patterns and associated flooding. The fundamental assumptions that underpin structural solutions are that the environmental pressures they are built to meet do not substantially change over time. Clearly, this is no longer the case. The UK government’s announcement of greater investment in flood defences is welcome, but this does not necessarily mean building longer and higher walls. What is needed is an integrated approach to flood defence that goes beyond using only structural solutions. Now, in the first decades of the century, the UK is in a period of transition that presents the opportunity to adjust our flood defences to the requirements of what this century’s climate will bring. In the years before the second world war, Japan faced the issue of building its resilience to earthquakes. Japan experiences on average at least one or two earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 to 7 or greater every year. These earthquakes used to kill many thousands of people, but the average death toll has significantly decreased and has fallen to a few tens of people in recent years (with exceptions, such as the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the earthquake that caused the 2011 tsunami). This has been achieved through a programme that combines technological development and significant public involvement. Japan holds annual and even monthly earthquake drills in schools and other public and private sector organisations. There is also earthquake education in schools and public information campaigns as well as nationwide earthquake warning messages through mobile phones. In earthquake or tsunami danger zones there are detailed signs to indicate areas at risk. These social approaches are pillars of Japan’s earthquake resilience programme, standing alongside the cutting-edge technological development of recent decades, such as seismic base isolation and motion-absorbing technology. The main outcome of Japan’s public education campaign has been that most people understand that while earthquakes cannot be prevented, their destructive impacts can be minimised, and that everyone has a role to play. This has been instrumental in bringing government and public together in building a more earthquake-resilient society. In fact, Japan has turned its massive challenge to an opportunity: protecting its economy and communities against earthquakes while becoming the leader in earthquake-mitigation technologies: state-of-the-art know-how that it exports to the world. Many nations worldwide struggle with flooding. Along with the Netherlands, Britain has been a pioneer in flood defence infrastructure engineering. This is an opportunity for the UK to not only address its flooding problems properly at home, but also to build on its existing reputation and take a leading role worldwide in developing new flood defence technology. To begin with, an information campaign is needed to inform the public of the new reality. Everyone should know that flooding is now a frequent risk – it may have been affordable to get flooded every 15 to 30 years in the past, but few can bear the expense of being flooded out of their home every few years as is possible now. The public must be properly informed that it is not technically possible to achieve zero flooding – and that in order to protect larger, denser populations in towns and cities, it may be necessary to accept flooding in other areas. Politicians and experts need to be honest with communities living in flood-prone areas that, given the current circumstances and the potential for the situation worsening in the future, there will need to be a managed retreat from areas deemed to too difficult or costly to protect. And people need to understand that pouring concrete everywhere is not the answer. Greater walls and hard surface areas serve only to guide rainwater into the river channel, which then subsequently bursts its banks. Instead, it would be better to strive to keep surfaces in their natural, permeable states through more widespread use of sustainable drainage systems. The storms that sweep across Europe form thousands of miles away in the Atlantic Ocean or in the deserts of North Africa – highlighting the importance of international cooperation to identify and coordinate actions to minimise the effects of global warming. At home, regular flood drills and flood education combined with flood signage in communities at risk are avenues that need to be pursued seriously. In the medium and long term, these efforts may help everyone understand that flooding is not a rare occurrence nor a one-off problem to be solved, but a natural phenomenon to be lived with. Flooding cannot be prevented, but the way we approach it can bring relief, and opportunities, for our communities and economy.

Original report, 20 December 2019: Heavy rain and strong winds hit parts of southern England from 18 to 19 December, 2019, causing flash flooding which damaged homes and disrupted transport. The worst hit area was Hayle in Cornwall, where as many as 50 homes and businesses were flooded. Cornwall Fire and Rescue were called in to help pump flooded areas. A major road near Hayle was closed due to flooding, prompting Devon and Cornwall Police to declare a major incident. Several vehicles were stranded in the flood water. The road has since re-opened. Devon and Cornwall Police said: “Due to recent heavy rain there is localised flooding across Devon and Cornwall making a number of roads impassable. Stay safe, drive with extra care, take notice of road closure signs and avoid driving into standing water at all times.” Roads were also flooded near Dorchester in Dorset. Rail travel was disrupted after flooding near Southampton blocked railway lines and heavy rain triggered a landslip blocking railway tracks in Liss, Hampshire. The UK’s Met Office has issued Yellow Level warnings for rain in parts of southern and eastern England until 22 December. As of 20 December there were 47 flood warnings and 194 flood alerts in place across England, mostly in the south and west.

UK – Brunel University London Launches Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience,"25 April, 2018","A new centre to help bolster the UK’s defences against flooding has launched at Brunel University London, offering a range of accredited e-learning programmes aimed at professionals from mid-September.  The Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience (CFR2) – which has been developed in partnership with the Environment Agency, and the environmental organisations HR Wallingford, Jacobs, ICE Blue and CIWEM – aims to help fill the skills gap currently faced by the sector. Backed by £200,000 from HEFCE’s Catalyst Fund, CFR2 will offer a suite of Chartered Institution of Water and Environment Management (CIWEM) accredited e-learning programmes aimed at professionals, before being expanded to include Brunel’s undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral courses in Flood and Coastal Engineering, which have run at the university since 2017. The first e-learning courses are expected to go online in mid-September. Professor Tassos Karayiannis of Brunel’s College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences and Director of the CFR2, said: “The Centre will complement our existing undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Flood and Coastal Engineering, which are offered alongside HR Wallingford and supported by the Environment Agency. “The Centre will provide new CIWEM accredited e-learning materials developed with our partners for new learners at both pre and post-university level, and at the same time offer an opportunity for an upgrade to professionals working in the field. “This will help reduce the national and international skills gap for professionals working in this multidisciplinary field.” The Catalyst Fund, launched by HEFCE before it became the Office for Students, aims to support the Government’s Industrial Strategy by developing the curriculum in areas of national importance. In total, £6.1m was awarded to 30 universities across the UK, with Brunel receiving the maximum amount possible for a single institution. Terry Fuller, Chief Executive of CIWEM, said: “The training of professionals to meet our global challenges of flood and coastal erosion risk management is a priority for CIWEM. We are pleased to support the development and accreditation of the courses offered by the centre” Paul Cross, Senior Skills, Efficiency and Resilience Advisor at the Environment Agency, said: “The Centre for Flood Resilience holds a great deal of promise and potential to enhance the skills and capabilities of those working in the sector, empower communities at risk through education and inspire future generations to forge an exciting career within the sector.” England",https://floodlist.com/protection/brunel-university-london-launches-centre-for-flood-risk-and-resilience,0,,6.1,,"UK, Wallingford",False,True,True,OtherFlood + Numerics

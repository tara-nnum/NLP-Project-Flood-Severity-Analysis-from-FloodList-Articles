UK – Evacuations After Floods in Devon and Somerset,"10 May, 2023","Storms and heavy rain brought flash flooding to parts of England and Wales, United Kingdom, on 09 May 2023. Homes and roads were flooded in Somerset and Devon in the South West. Flooding was also reported in North Wales and parts of South East England. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said it received “widespread” calls for help due to flooding from around midday on 09 May 2023. Around 5 homes were flooded along with several roads in areas of Exeter, Devon. Roads and school buildings were affected in Tipton St John, near Exeter. The weather station at the Exeter Met Office recorded 41.5 mm of rain in 24 hours to early 10 May. A farm building was destroyed and a vehicle damaged after floods in Newton Poppleford, Devon. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service carried out at least 4 rescue operations for motorists trapped in floods in Taunton. In North Cadbury, Somerset, residents were forced to evacuate after 18 homes in the area were flooded. Seven flood warnings were in place as of 10 May 2023, including for the River Cam, which flows through the village of North Cadbury. Levels of the River Cam at nearby Weston Bampfylde reached 2.85 metres on 09 May. According to the Environment Agency, property flooding is possible above 0.60 metres. Flood warnings are still in place for areas between  Weston Bampfylde and Speckington. The River Otter at Dotton, near Newton Poppleford, reached 1.55 metres on 09 May. According to the Environment Agency, flooding of low-lying land is possible above 1.40 metres. Areas of Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Essex and Cambridgeshire in England saw heavy rain as the storms moved east. Some rail services from Cambridge were suspended due to severe weather. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service say they received a number of reports of flash floods in the Wrexham area, where several roads were flooded.

Intense Downpours in the UK Will Increase Due to Climate Change Says New study,"9 March, 2023","In the United Kingdom, intense downpours exceeding 20mm of rain per hour could be four times more frequent by the year 2080 compared with the 1980s, writes Elizabeth Kendon, University of Bristol, for The Conversation. In July 2021, Kew in London experienced a month’s rain in just three hours. Across the city, tube lines were suspended and stations closed as London experienced its wettest day in decades and flash floods broke out. Just under two weeks later, it happened again: intense downpours led to widespread disruption, including the flooding of two London hospitals. Colleagues and I have created a new set of 100-year climate projections to more accurately assess the likelihood of heavy rain downpours like these over the coming years and decades. The short answer is climate change means these extreme downpours will happen more often in the UK – and be even more intense. To generate these projections, we used the Met Office operational weather forecast model, but run on long climate timescales. This provided very detailed climate projections – for every 2.2km grid box over the UK, for every hour, for 100 years from 1981 to 2080. These are much more detailed than traditional climate projections and needed to be run as a series of 20-year simulations that were then stitched together. Even on the Met Office supercomputer, these still took about six months to run. We ran 12 such 100-year projections. We are not interested in the weather on a given day but rather how the occurrence of local weather extremes varies year by year. By starting the model runs in the past, it is also possible to verify the output against observations to assess the model’s performance. At this level of detail – the “k-scale” – it is possible to more accurately assess how the most extreme downpours will change. This is because k-scale simulations better represent the small-scale atmospheric processes, such as convection, that can lead to destructive flash flooding. Our results are now published in Nature Communications. We found that under a high emissions scenario downpours in the UK exceeding 20mm per hour could be four times as frequent by the year 2080 compared with the 1980s. This level of rainfall can potentially produce serious damage through flash flooding, with thresholds like 20mm/hr used by planners to estimate the risk of flooding when water overwhelms the usual drainage channels. Previous less detailed climate models project a much lower increase of around two and a half times over the same period. We note that these changes are assuming that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at current rates. This is therefore a plausible but upper estimate. If global carbon emissions follow a lower emissions scenario, extreme rain will still increase in the UK – though at a slower rate. However, the changes are not inevitable, and if we emit less carbon in the coming decades, extreme downpours will be less frequent. The increases are significantly greater in certain regions. For example, extreme rainfall in north-west Scotland could be almost ten times more common, while it’s closer to three times more frequent in the south of the UK. The greater future increases in the number of extreme rainfall events in the higher resolution model compared with more traditional lower resolution climate models shows the importance of having k-scale projections to enable society to adapt to climate change. As the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, at a rate of 7% more moisture for every degree of warming. On a simple level, this explains why in many regions of the world projections show an increase in precipitation as a consequence of human-induced climate change. This new study has shown that, in the UK, the intensity of downpours could increase by about 5% in the south and up to about 15% in the north for every degree of regional warming. However, it is far from a simple picture of more extreme events, decade by decade, as a steadily increasing trend. Instead, we expect periods of rapid change – with records being broken, some by a considerable margin – and periods when there is a pause, with no new records set. This is simply a reflection of the complex interplay between natural variability and the underlying climate change signal. An analogy for this is waves coming up a beach on an incoming tide. The tide is the long-term rising trend, but there are periods when there are larger waves, followed by lulls. Despite the underlying trend, the time between record-breaking events at the local scale can be surprisingly long – even several decades. Our research marks the first time that such a high-resolution data set has spanned over a century. As well as being a valuable asset for planners and policymakers to prepare for the future, it can also be used by climate attribution scientists to examine current extreme rainfall events to see how much more likely they will have been because of human greenhouse gas emissions. The research highlights the importance of meeting carbon emissions targets and also planning for increasingly prevalent extreme rainfall events, which to varying degrees of intensity, look highly likely in all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The tendency for extreme years to cluster poses challenges for communities trying to adapt to intense downpours and risks infrastructure being unprepared, since climate information based on several decades of past observations may not be representative of the following decades.

"UK – One Missing After Flash Floods in Scotland, 140mm of Rain in 48 Hours","19 November, 2022","Police in UK report that one person is missing after being swept away by flash floods in Scotland on 18 November 2022. Heavy rain fell across Scotland from 16 November, in particular areas of the north east. The UK’s Met Office said close to a month’s worth of rain fell across parts of Aberdeenshire and Angus in 48 hours to 18 November. As much as 140 mm of rain was recorded in Charr in Aberdeenshire. The village of Aboyne in Aberdeenshire recorded 71.4 mm of rain in 24 hours on 18 November. Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said “We are seeing significant impacts from rivers in parts of Aberdeenshire and Angus. Seven severe flood warnings are live in Kintore, Kemnay, Inverurie, Ballater and Aberdeen (Dee), Brechin and Finavon and Tannadice.” One person was reported missing after being swept away by flash flooding in Aberdeenshire. Scotland’s North East Police Division said searches are continuing following a report of concern for a woman in the water at the River Don near Monymusk on the afternoon of Friday, 18 November. Inspector Rory Campbell said: “Officers, along with colleagues from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and the Coastguard, have resumed searches in the area where the woman was last seen. “Conditions are tricky and dangerous and I am appealing to members of the public to stay away from flooded areas. Please be careful when you are out and about.” Aberdeenshire Council opened rest centres in Ballater, Aboyne, Inverurie and Kemnay for those needing help and who are unable to stay in their homes. Local media reported residents of Ballater were preparing for severe flooding as levels of the Muick and Dee rivers were rising. Around 40 caravans were evacuated from Ballater Caravan Park. Rail services were severely impacted. Hundreds of travellers were left stranded in Newcastle, England, due to the cancelled services to Scotland. Several roads were flooded in Aberdeenshire as well as parts of Angus, Fife and Dundee districts. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said “Our Operations Control rooms are receiving a high number of emergency calls due to flooding in Brechin, Forfar and Dundee. We ask the public for their co-operation. Please only call if there is a serious emergency with risk to life.” Cars were seen partially submerged along a major road near Ladybank in Fife. Some residents evacuated their homes in Brechin. Localised flooding was reported in areas of Edinburgh, leaving vehicles stranded. Earlier in the week heavy rain caused flooding on roads in southern England, in particular in West Sussex. Local media reported 20 vehicles trapped on a flooded road in Chichester on 16 November 2022. West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said they responded to 70 flood-related incidents, including rescuing people from cars and flooding in buildings.

UK – Hundreds of Homes Damaged After Storm Franklin Causes Rivers to Rise,"23 February, 2022","Hundreds of homes have been flooded in England and Wales after heavy rainfall from Storm Franklin caused rivers to rise from 20 February 2022. Authorities say flood defences have protected more than 40,000 properties despite record river levels. The Environment Agency said the worst of the flooding in England was along the River Ouse in Yorkshire and the River Severn in the West Midlands, where a severe flood warning (highest) was issued for Ironbridge in Shropshire and Bewdley in Worcestershire. Some residents have evacuated their homes, while roads have been closed and rail services suspended. The Buildwas measuring station showed the Severn reached 6.55 metres late on 22 February but has since fallen slightly. The record high here is 7.04 metres recorded in November 2000. The River Severn at Bewdley stood at 5.33 metres as of 23 February and was expected to rise slightly later in the day. The record high is 5.56 metres, also recorded in November 2000. Damage to homes and some evacuations were reported after rivers caused flooding in other areas of the country from 20 February, including the Mersey in Greater Manchester, the Derwent in Derbyshire, the Wharfe in North and West Yorkshire and the Don in South Yorkshire. The River Mersey at Brinksway in Greater Manchester reached a record 4.4 metres on 20 February, beating the previous high of 3.97 metres set on 6 November 2000. Katharine Smith, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said, “So far we have received reports of around 400 properties having flooded over the past few days. Our thoughts go out to all those affected – flooding can and does have a devastating impact on people’s lives. “We have teams out on the ground taking preventative action, closing flood gates, deploying temporary barriers and moving pumps and other response equipment to areas of highest risk. Environment Agency defences have protected more than 40,000 properties despite record river levels.” In Wales, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) reported high levels of the River Severn in Powys. Residents of Llandinam near Newtown evacuated their homes after flooding late on 20 February. Franklin is the third named storm to hit the UK within a week, following Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice, which killed three people and left 1.4 million homes without power. Franklin also cause some coastal and flash flooding in parts of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Two people drowned after their car was swept away by strong waves in Bricqueville-sur-Mer, northern France on 20 February 2022.

UK – Widespread Flooding After Storm Bella,"28 December, 2020","Heavy rainfall brought by Storm Bella caused flooding across Central England over the last few days,  prompting evacuation orders and high water rescues. Strong winds from the storm also caused severe damages and left thousands of households in France and the UK without electricity. The Isle of Wight in southern England saw wind gusts of 170km/h. Heavy rain from the storm caused rivers to break their banks in parts of Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Worcestershire. Authorities advised residents of 1,300 homes in Bedfordshire to evacuate on 25 December following flooding from the River Great Ouse. Around 40 homes suffered flood damage in the town of Bedford. Around 1,000 people were evacuated from a flooded caravan park at Billing Aquadrome in Northamptonshire after the River Nene broke its banks. A further 20 homes were evacuated in Kettering, Northamptonshire Search and Rescue Services said. Severe flooding was also reported along the Severn in Worcestershire, in particular in areas around the small town of Upton-upon-Severn. Heavy rain caused flash flooding in Oxfordshire on 24 December. About 40 homes were flooded in Witney and Fewcott. In Norfolk, hundreds of families in Thetford, Brandon and Hockwold were advised to leave their homes on 26 December due to the threat of flooding from the rising River Little Ouse. In Cambridgeshire the River Great Ouse broke its banks causing flooding in several areas including the town of St Neots. In North Yorkshire, flash floods overnight, 26 to 27 December prompted high water rescues in Hawes, Aysgarth and Wensley, according to North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.

"Europe – Storms Cause Flash Flooding and Landslides in UK, France and Italy","13 August, 2020","After days of high temperatures, heavy rainfall brought by summer storms has caused flooding and landslides in parts of the United Kingdom, France and Italy. This follows dramatic flash flooding in southern Spain after almost 50mm of rainfall fell in 1 hour. In the UK, flash flooding was reported in Scotland after heavy rainfall 11 to 12 August, 2020. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it received more than 1,000 emergency calls due to the severe weather. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said in a statement of 12 August: “Following heavy thunderstorms overnight SEPA has a number of Flood Alerts in place and Flood Warnings in Aberdeenshire, Angus and Tayside. Small watercourses responded rapidly to the intense rainfall and localised impacts from these watercourses and small river catchments have been reported in East Lothian, Fife, Perth, and Stonehaven. A number of properties have been flooded in all the areas mentioned and a number of schools and roads have also been closed due to these floods.” Authorities in Fife declared a “major incident” after flash floods caused severe damage across the region. Evacuations were carried out after a landslide near Kinghorn. Some of the worst of the flooding was in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, where the heavy rain is also thought to have triggered a landslide near which derailed a train. Three people died and 6 were injured in the derailment. British Transport Police said they will conduct an investigation into the cause of the incident.

UK – Mass Evacuations As Dam Threatens to Break,"2 August, 2019","As many as 6,500 people have been evacuated from a town in Derbyshire, England, after the partial collapse of Toddbrook Reservoir dam. Heavy rain over the last few days also caused flooding in neighbouring parts of Cheshire and Greater Manchester, where emergency services rescued over 20 people from flooded properties. Heavy rain over the last few days caused the Toddbrook Reservoir dam to overflow, damaging the dam’s spillway in circumstances similar to the damaged spillway at Lake Oroville Dam in Northern California in February 2017. Local media report that virtually the whole town of Whaley Bridge was evacuated after the Environment Agency issued a “danger to life” warning. The agency said: “River levels in the River Goyt could still rise rapidly as a result of persistent rain and water coming from Toddbrook Reservoir on 01/08/2019. Evacuation plans are currently underway for the area of Whaley Bridge.” A military helicopter has been deployed to shore up flood defences and the dam wall. Around 150 firefighters were also on the scene using high-volume pumps to extract water. Areas of northern and central England have seen heavy rain over the last few days. Major flooding was reported in parts of Yorkshire on 30 July, damaging roads and bridges. The following day areas to the south of Manchester saw heavy rain. Firefighters rescued over 20 people from flooded properties in Poynton and Bramhall. Cheshire Fire and Rescue Services said that on 31 July, flash flooding caused major issues in the Poynton, Bollington and Wilmslow, affecting around 60 properties and resulting in a number of road closures. Between 60-90mm of rain fell in 24 hours. The rail line between Manchester Airport and Wilmslow, Cheshire, was blocked due to flooding as was the Manchester Airport link road.

UK – Flash Floods Cause Severe Damage in North of England,"31 July, 2019","A bridge was destroyed and roads washed away after torrential rain caused flash flooding in parts of northern England on 30 and 31 July, 2019. The worst of the damage was seen in the Yorkshire Dales National Park area. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said it received about 115 calls to flooding in Leyburn and Reeth during the evening of 30 July. A spokesman said: “We had several appliances, as well as our swift water rescue teams and high-volume pumping appliance within the area attending various incidents involving flooded properties and cars stuck in flood water.” A small bridge over a stream near Grinton was destroyed and a road near Richmond was washed away by the flooding. Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team said via Social Media: “Please note heavy flooding on all roads in the Swaledale area only travel if essential as many routes impassable. Although water levels are slowly easing some bridges are ‘out’ & lots of debris on the roads.” A landslip on 30 July blocked train tracks between Carlisle and Skipton, disrupting rail travel. The BBC reported that Malham Tarn in the Yorkshire Dales recorded 3.2 inches (82.2mm) of rain in 24 hours, the majority in the space of four hours. The monthly average in the area for this time of year is 3.5in (89mm). Heavy rain on 31 July flooded railway tracks between Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent, causing severe travel disruption. As of 31 July, the Environment Agency had 9 flood warnings and 33 flood alerts in place for areas of northern and central England. More rain is expected and the UK’s Met Office has issued a yellow warning for rain in the north of England and western parts of Scotland. The Met Office said: “Some parts of northern England could see as much as 40-60mm of rain through Wednesday, while thunderstorms could produce as much as 30-40mm in one to two hours.” A yellow severe weather warning for #rain has been updated: https://t.co/QwDLMfRBfs Stay #weatheraware @metofficeuk pic.twitter.com/abHCVaJYfn — Met Office (@metoffice) July 31, 2019  Literally stranded on road near Leyburn with both ends flooded and nowhere to go!! pic.twitter.com/IcJieqpnE5 — Mark Worrall (@ChesterBluey) July 30, 2019  Lots of reports of flash flooding around Leyburn and Reeth so please take care if you're driving in that area.

UK – Rescues After Heavy Rain Causes Floods in Scotland,"25 June, 2019","Hours of heavy rain on 24 June caused flash flooding in Scotland’s capital Edinburgh and other eastern and central parts of the country. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said on 24 June via Social Media, “Intense rainfall continues to move north across central belt and eastern Scotland, resulting in surface water disruption on urban roads and transport links.” The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said firefighters worked throughout East and Central Scotland with partners to protect communities and property as torrential rain caused widespread localised flooding. In Edinburgh, flooded streets caused problems for the city’s drivers and public transport. Tram services were temporarily suspended in some areas after flood water had covered tracks. According to the UK’s Met Office, Edinburgh saw 44.4mm of rain in 24 hours to 24 June. In Stirling, central Scotland, heavy rain caused damage to several buildings including a supermarket. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service reported that they rescued 14 people stranded in a flooded building during the evening of 24 June. Surface flooding was also reported in the town of Kirkcaldy on the east coast, where several public buildings were closed as a result. https://twitter.com/metoffice/status/1143119457512017928 A man has been filmed sitting on top of a car during floods in Edinburgh.

UK – 1 Man Dead as Severe Floods Hit West Midlands and Wales,"28 May, 2018","A stormy holiday weekend (26 to 28 May, 2018) in the UK saw 136,000 lightning strikes across the country, along with heavy rainfall and flooding in the West Midlands and parts of Wales. Police say that an elderly man has died after his car was submerged in water during the flooding in Rushall, an area of Walsall in the West Midlands, about 15 km north of Birmingham. In a statement, West Midlands Police said “A man has died after his vehicle was submerged in flood water in Walsall following flash flooding that hit the region. Police were called to Lichfield Road, Rushall, just after 2am today (Monday 28 May) to reports that a vehicle had entered the water. The victim, who is believed to be in his 80s, was taken to hospital but pronounced dead a short time later.” A number of roads in the Birmingham area, including Walsall, were badly affected by the flooding after torrential rain fell overnight. Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service (WFRS) said their control room was extremely busy dealing with flooding calls and crews have visited many properties to assist where they can with flooding. WFRS Technical Rescue Unit said they carried out multiple rescues from cars, buses and homes. WFRS asked people to avoid the areas of Flecknoe, Willoughby and Lower Shuckburgh which were affected by fast flowing water late on 27 May. Warwickshire police reported flooding in the Lapworth and Hockley Heath areas, Lower Shuckburgh, Earlswood Lakes and Rugby. Five buildings in Warwickshire were struck by lightning during the storm. Flood water up to 1 metre was reported in Welshpool, Powys, about 75 km west of Walsall and flooded areas of Birmingham. Homes, roads and vehicles were damaged as well as the Victoria Memorial Hospital, according to local media. The UK’s Met Office said that Winterbourne in Edgbaston (Birmingham), recorded 53.6 mm of rainfall in just one hour on Sunday afternoon, and 93.6 mm in a 24-hour period. The May monthly average for the area is around 55 mm. Bala in Gwynedd, about 40 km north west of Welshpool, recorded 54 mm of rain in 24 hours. The Met Office had issued an Orange (mid-level) warning for heavy rain across a narrow patch over North Wales and the West Midlands.

"UK – Flash Flooding in England Leaves Drivers Stranded, Travel Disrupted","25 September, 2019","Heavy rain on 24 September caused localised flash flooding across parts of England, causing havoc for traffic and public transport. At one point the Environment Agency issued 39 alerts and 12 warnings. Boscombe Down in Wiltshire recorded the day’s highest rainfall total with 55.8 mm. Local media reported flooded roads in parts of the North West, Midlands and the South East including London. The UK’s Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: ‘This pattern of very unsettled weather will remain right through until the weekend before another deep low arrives on Sunday. ‘This is due to the jet stream which has moved over the south of the UK and is steering unsettled weather in from the Atlantic. ‘There will be some quite intense rainfall through the next week and the risk of strong winds in parts of the country.’ Thousands of commuters in London were hit by severe delays with railway lines flooded and tube stations closed. Fire fighters in Buckinghamshire were called on to rescue people from vehicles trapped in flood water in areas around Ibstone. In Liverpool, vehicles were also trapped in floodwater according to Mersey Fire and Rescue Service.
